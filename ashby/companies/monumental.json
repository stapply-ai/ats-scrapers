Help us bring our robots to life and join our mission to bring automation to the construction industry to create affordable, beautiful, high-quality housing for everyone.\n\nAt Monumental, we\u2019re building an operating system to make on-site construction possible with robotics. Our software stack allows us to do everything from 3D reconstruction (through photogrammetry) of a construction site, design of 3D structures that will be built, supply chain, path planning, and inverse/forward kinematics of our robots.\n\nSome of the types of challenges you might be working on:\n\n1. Designing and modeling a localization and control system for our autonomous ground vehicles that can move around a construction site\n\n2. Designing or optimizing specific control loops, e.g. for mortar flow control through different sensors (e.g. a load cell, or time-of-flight sensors)\n\n3. Design and optimize new motions for a 4DOF XYZ-style crane or explore adding a new degree of freedom to the system\n\n4. Implementing production-level code at whatever level makes sense (embedded firmware in C++, or our application layer in Rust) necessary to bring your algorithms to life.\n\nHelp us bring our robots to life and join our mission to bring automation to the construction industry to create affordable, beautiful, high-quality housing for everyone.
