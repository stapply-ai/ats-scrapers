Many of the best long-term investments \u2014 like water-efficient irrigation or improved grazing rotations \u2014 support both the land and the bottom line.

Teach: Sales team members how to best contribute product feedback, close customers, and get to the next level.\n\n - Learn: Ins and outs of building an agrifinance and climate tech company, including the nitty gritty of agricultural bookkeeping, the larger farm finance ecosystem, and natural resource management / ESG tie-ins.\n\n - Improve: Our existing team processes, playbooks, and mentorship structures.\n\nWithin 1 month you'll...\n\n - Lead Ambrook demos end-to-end, walking customers through our product and closing them independently.\n\n -

Provide feedback to our Product team to influence prioritization of our product roadmap.\n\n - Determine appropriate resourcing and hire necessary team members to adequately cover our hypergrowth this winter season\n\n -
