We\u2019re just finishing the job, using AI agents to automate all knowledge work.\n\nOur goal is to build AI employees that can collaborate with humans and other AI employees across all channels (email, Slack, Zoom, phone calls, etc), pursue ambiguous goals in dynamic contexts, and continuously learn from their experience.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAs an Engineering Manager at Lindy, you\u2019ll lead three core engineering teams: Application Experience, Growth, and Integrations. These teams are at the heart of how customers experience Lindy, how we expand adoption, and how we connect with the broader ecosystem.\n\nYou\u2019ll own the roadmap end-to-end: scoping projects, sequencing milestones, unblocking engineers, and making sure we ship features that delight customers with urgency and velocity. You\u2019ll triage issues, make smart trade-offs between speed and long-term quality, and keep projects moving fast.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a heavyweight process role. You\u2019ll be embedded in a small, lean, and focused team, working directly with product, design, and Lindy\u2019s Head of Engineering and CEO to keep momentum high. You\u2019ll debug both systems and people, cut scope when needed, and push projects across the finish line.
