That\u2019s where Zapier comes in.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re looking for high-impact individuals with deep experience in AI and automation - especially those coming from consulting, systems integration, or platform strategy roles. You may not have traditional go-to-market (GTM) experience, but you know how to turn AI into business outcomes. We\u2019ll work with you to shape your impact across our GTM team - whether that\u2019s Customer Success, Solutions Architecture, Account Executive, or Technical Account Management.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you're excited to help customers adopt, integrate, and scale AI using Zapier\u2019s orchestration layer, we want to hear from you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>For this role, we're targeting candidates in the Americas.</em><br /></p><h3><em><strong>Why This Role Is Different</strong></em></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Zapier is no longer just a no-code automation tool - we\u2019re the connective tissue of modern AI systems. Our platform orchestrates over 8,000 apps, tools, and APIs, enabling companies to deploy AI in powerful, scalable ways - without rebuilding their stack. As we evolve into an AI orchestration platform, we need forward-thinking GTM teammates who understand this emerging landscape and can help our customers navigate it.</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://zapier.com/jobs/our-commitment-to-applicants/\">Our Commitment to Applicants</a></p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://zapier.com/jobs/culture-and-values-at-zapier/\">Culture and Values at Zapier</a></p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/\">Zapier Guide to Remote Work</a></p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/\">Zapier Code of Conduct</a></p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://zapier.com/jobs/working-on-diversity-and-inclusivity/\">Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier</a></p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>About You</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>You deliver exceptional results in all you do.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve been in high-impact roles where you\u2019ve consistently been a top performer. Perhaps you\u2019ve been in the trenches at a startup, worked on enterprise transformations at a top consulting firm, or navigated the chaos of investment banking.

Your work will directly fuel our customers\u2019 success https://zapier.com/zapconnect, and as they grow, so will you.\n\nHi there!\n\nZapier is building the world\u2019s first AI orchestration platform - one that connects tools, data, and humans into automated systems that work for you. As businesses race to integrate AI into their workflows, they face a new kind of challenge: making all their tools and AI agents talk to each other, reliably and at scale. That\u2019s where Zapier comes in.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for high-impact individuals with deep experience in AI and automation - especially those coming from consulting, systems integration, or platform strategy roles. You may not have traditional go-to-market (GTM) experience, but you know how to turn AI into business outcomes. We\u2019ll work with you to shape your impact across our GTM team - whether that\u2019s Customer Success, Solutions Architecture, Account Executive, or Technical Account Management.\n\nIf you're excited to help customers adopt, integrate, and scale AI using Zapier\u2019s orchestration layer, we want to hear from you.\n\nFor this role, we're targeting candidates in the Americas.\n\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE IS DIFFERENT\n\nZapier is no longer just a no-code automation tool - we\u2019re the connective tissue of modern AI systems. Our platform orchestrates over 8,000 apps, tools, and APIs, enabling companies to deploy AI in powerful, scalable ways - without rebuilding their stack. As we evolve into an AI orchestration platform, we need forward-thinking GTM teammates who understand this emerging landscape and can help our customers navigate it.\n\n - Our Commitment to Applicants https://zapier.com/jobs/our-commitment-to-applicants/\n\n - Culture and Values at Zapier https://zapier.com/jobs/culture-and-values-at-zapier/\n\n - Zapier Guide to Remote Work https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/\n\n - Zapier Code of Conduct https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/\n\n - Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier https://zapier.com/jobs/working-on-diversity-and-inclusivity/\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\nYou deliver exceptional results in all you do.\n\nYou\u2019ve been in high-impact roles where you\u2019ve consistently been a top performer.
