Our growth is explosive. 10x last year, 20% MoM, raised $3M seed from Pear a few months ago, 300+ businesses using us today (1000+ by year-end). We've discovered a completely overlooked path to dominate this SMB market while everyone else is fighting over enterprise deals.\n\n\nOUR VISION\n\nWhile conventional wisdom says SMBs are challenging (low contract values, high churn), we've discovered unique growth opportunities where others weren't looking. SMBs represent half of US GDP and need AI solutions as much as enterprises do. We're making that possible.\n\nOur early traction proves the model works - now we need the right product leader to help us scale. We started with AI receptionists and quickly expanded into something far more powerful. Our platform is the SMB Customer Revenue Engine - AI agents handling all conversations, an intelligence layer learning from every interaction, and outbound AI driving real revenue growth. Our vision is bold: to become the SMB super app\u2014a single, intelligent platform that manages everything for SMBs, from customer acquisition to retention.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\nYou\u2019ll be our first full-stack founding engineer, with an outsized role in how the product evolves.

We work with some of the world\u2019s largest law firms, helping them to solve their most complex cases, find the winning strategy in each matter, and create clarity from the chaos of documents and facts in each case. We are a rapidly growing, legal AI company based in London. Clifford Chance, HSFKramer, Goodwin, Addleshaw Goddard and more rely on us to help find the critical facts that can determine their chances of winning a case.\n\nWe\u2019re backed with a $5.3M Seed by Pear VC, Seedcamp, The LegalTechFund + many leading industry angels.\n\nWe are building a comprehensive AI platform for managing, resolving and preventing legal disputes across Enterprise law firms and Fortune500 companies. We are growing 10x YoY and signing more eminent firms every month. Our system extracts, objective, cross referenced facts from millions of documents, helping litigators win more cases whilst saving months of working hours. In this way we ensure every client gets the representation they deserve.\n\nAI is transforming the law, but most tools have focused on contract law or are generalist copilots that aggregate the tasks lawyers do across practices. Wexler is the leading gen-AI platform specifically built for the nuances of litigation, and our growth proves the story is resonating.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nThe litigation landscape is changing forever thanks to generative AI. Customer Success is driving this change. We're looking for an experienced, entrepreneurial Customer Success Lead with a demonstrated commercial record to join our growing team in London and help drive how the world's top law firms on both sides of the Atlantic adopt, scale, and win with Wexler's platform for expert litigators.\n\nAs the primary Customer Success lead for Wexler, you will oversee the full client lifecycle, on-boarding, training, adoption, renewal and expansion, ensuring every firm sees measurable value from the start. You will build trusted, long-term relationships with partners and senior associates, running regular health checks and strategic reviews, while proactively monitoring usage analytics, resolving issues and funnelling product feedback to Engineering. Your remit includes creating best-practice playbooks and knowledge-base content that scale expertise across our user community, and protecting and growing revenue by accurately forecasting renewals, identifying upsell opportunities and negotiating commercial terms that align with client outcomes.\n\nBeyond traditional CS duties, you will become Wexler\u2019s in-house litigation specialist. You\u2019ll guide fee-earners through complex workflows and make them experts in Wexler\u2019s product, covering all of their day-to-day responsibilities and feeding back your insights to product. As our first Customer Success hire you'll have the unique opportunity to build our entire customer engagement strategy from scratch, working directly with the CEO and Co-Founder to establish the playbooks and processes that will scale with our explosive growth trajectory.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\nYou'll become the trusted litigation AI expert for our clients, working directly with partners, associates, and corporate legal teams to maximise their document processing and case strategy capabilities. Your focus will be driving measurable usage growth that translates directly to revenue expansion.\n\nManage accounts and renewals across our customer base, focusing on driving Net Revenue Retention, ensuring no churn and maximising enterprise value.\n\nDrive document volume and usage growth across your client portfolio of elite law firms and Fortune500 corporate legal teams, focusing on expanding Wexler adoption into new matters and practice areas.\n\nMaster complex legal workflows to guide clients through sophisticated implementations, from initial case setup to advanced fact extraction across millions of documents.\n\nBecome a litigation strategy consultant, working alongside legal teams to identify high-impact use cases where our AI can uncover case-winning facts and dramatically reduce document review time.\n\nOwn commercial expansion within accounts by identifying new matters, practice groups, and office locations where Wexler can drive results, then negotiating usage-based pricing expansions.\n\nBuild deep relationships with key stakeholders across both law firm partnerships and corporate legal departments, understanding their dispute resolution strategies and budget cycles.\n\nAnalyse usage patterns and case outcomes to demonstrate ROI through concrete metrics like time savings, document processing efficiency, and case success rates.\n\nPartner closely with our technical teams to ensure client feedback shapes our AI capabilities, particularly around the nuances of different litigation types and jurisdictions.\n\nPioneer our customer engagement methodology as we scale our client base from dozens to hundreds of the world's most demanding legal organisations.\n\n\nWHAT YOU BRING\n\nYou understand that litigation AI isn't just another software implementation - it's a fundamental shift in how legal professionals approach their most complex disputes.

This is your chance to reimagine one of the most under-designed spaces in software.\n\nTesting tools & Testing Systems Traditionally look like this \u2026..\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/cca476c0-947e-4006-a2cb-409350de667a/319a3da2-4fb7-4eb0-9bbc-80bb20823b00/image.png]\n\nWith Spur, testing isn\u2019t siloed in engineering or QA. Now, anyone on the team\u2014from PMs to support and sales\u2014can create and run tests using natural language.\n\nThat shift changes everything.\n\nWe\u2019re eliminating the need for heavy testing teams and infrastructure\u2014while raising the quality bar. The UX is central to making this possible. It has to feel trustworthy, intuitive, and powerful, all at once.\n\nAI is integrated at every stage of the journey\u2014test creation, editing, execution, and reporting. Designing seamless, AI-driven workflows that build user confidence will be one of your most exciting and impactful challenges.\n\nWe see this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine what UI/UX for software testing looks like\u2014and we\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s excited to take that on.\n\n\nWE WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU IF:\n\n - You\u2019re your own toughest critic and hold yourself to an exceptionally high standard\u201490% isn\u2019t good enough. You move fast, take initiative, and care deeply about doing things right.\n\n - You don\u2019t just point out problems\u2014you roll up your sleeves and solve them.\n\n - You\u2019ve shipped complex, high-quality products, ideally with 2+ years of experience designing for technical or ops-heavy users.\n\n - You\u2019re comfortable navigating ambiguity and bringing structure where none exists.\n\n - You move quickly, but never at the expense of craft and polish.\n\n\nTHE CORE WORK WILL INCLUDE:\n\n\nFIRST 6 MONTHS\n\n - Own end-to-end product design, from early ideation through polished, shipped experiences\n\n - Create Spur\u2019s visual identity\u2014including brand, design system, and style guidelines\n\n - Design entirely new user workflows that make complex systems feel fast, intuitive, and powerful\n\n - Drive a culture of craft, where design quality and attention to detail are valued across the company\n\n - Work closely with engineering and product to shape the roadmap through a design lens\n\n - Help define our voice and presence\u2014not just in-product, but across marketing and how Spur shows up in the world\n\n\nWHERE THIS ROLE CAN GROW\n\n - Build & lead the design team, including hiring and team culture\n\n - Shape our public design voice, through thought leadership, events, talks, and writing\n   \n   - Reference: https://jam.dev/blog/behind-the-scenes-our-startups-new-onboarding-flow-2/ andy2Raising the Volume Quietly: A Designer\u2019s Challenge \u2022 Slack D\u2026 https://slack.design/articles/raising-the-volume-quietly/\n   \n   - Reference: https://www.shopify.com/blog/blog-design\n\n - Collaborate on GTM, helping craft assets, launch moments, and social content\n\n - Host design gatherings and represent Spur at industry events and conferences\n\n\nBONUS POINTS IF YOU:\n\n - Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages\n\n - Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people\n\n - Passion for ML/AI and its potential in product design\n\nThis is an in person role at our office in NYC.
