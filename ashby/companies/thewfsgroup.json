fast paced, high performance sales agency that provides what is referred to as \u201cdone for you sales\u201d services to our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency\u2026. But focused on sales! Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services/packages to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people\u2019s lives as possible. The main verticals we service are in the online, digital marketing based community with companies that have educational programs that teach high paying skill sets which is referred to as \u201calternative education.\u201d We sell a range of transformative programs and packages including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more. The world is changing and so is the education space with college application and admission rates down significantly. Bespoke alternative education is a multi billion dollar a year industry and growing, and you can be a part of the gold rush. We believe people\u2019s dream lives are just on the other side of receiving the right information- we\u2019re responsible for getting that to them.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Competitive Comp Structure &amp; Earning Potential!</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Selling Life Changing Products!</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Managing Top Performing Fully Remote Sales Teams!</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Position Overview:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an outsourced sales company, one of the main ways we differentiate ourselves is by positioning that we are not just \u201cdone for you sales\u201d but rather \u201cdone for you sales operations.\u201d The distinction is that while competitors just simply provide the sales talent, we bring a more comprehensive solution that includes sales management and all of our scaling systems. Needless to say, the Sales Manager is a critical role in our sales management infrastructure, and in the overall solution we provide to our clients.. The way our management structure is designed is that each Sales Manager oversees a few key accounts depending on the size, sales volume, and overall workload. This dynamic role varies in day to day responsibilities based on the specific demands of the assigned accounts and the critical areas of focus, but includes overseeing pipeline management, consistently conducting call reviews, evaluating rep performance, ensuring CRM data &amp;
