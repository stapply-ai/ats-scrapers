You enjoy taking ownership and are stifled by large organizations.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\n - Bring beauty and simplicity to complex ideas.\n\n - Produce high-quality, production-ready designs while creating a best-in-class user experience.\n\n - Be autonomous. You\u2019ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.\n\n - Work with multi-disciplinary teams. You\u2019ll partner closely with engineering, product, marketing, and business folks to find elegant solutions to design challenges.\n\n - Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes, knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail and when to make low-fi sketches.\n\n - Actively contribute to testing to uphold the quality of implementation of your designs.\n\n - Learn and become a guardian of our consistent design framework and standards to bring the Solace brand to life.\n\nWhat You Bring to the Table\n\n - Comfort with ambiguity.\n\n - Curiosity for all things beautiful. While we do not design for design's sake, your appreciation for the finer details matters. Good design isn't noticed, but felt; you deeply understand this concept.\n\n - Intuition on what it takes to create delightful, consumer-oriented experiences.\n\n - Exceptional skills with design tools. We worship at the altar of Figma, so your fluency is imperative.\n\n - A bias toward action and execution. You get nervous if you\u2019re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work.\n\n - Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life.\n\n - 1-5 years of relevant experience designing consumer web products for desktop and mobile.\n\n - An online portfolio of your work.\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe are a team of ambitious individuals who are passionate about putting healthcare back into the hands of patients. At Solace, you will have an unparalleled opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest-growing healthcare startups in the U.S. The work you do here will have a noticeable and direct impact on the development of the company.\n\nApplicants must be based in the United States.\n\nUp for the Challenge?\n\nWe look forward to meeting you.\n\nFraudulent Recruitment Advisory: Solace Health will NEVER request bank details or offer employment without an interview.
