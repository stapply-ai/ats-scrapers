Within Seller Growth, the Platform pod ensures that this growth is sustainable, trustworthy, and scalable.\n\nAs our next software engineer on the Seller Growth Platform pod, you will design and build the systems that sit at the heart of the new seller funnel. Your work will focus on:\n\n - Protecting the funnel from fraud and abuse: Developing and scaling systems for identity verification (IDV), fraud detection, and automated trust/risk reviews that safeguard buyers while minimizing friction for good sellers.\n\n - Balancing growth with trust and safety: Ensuring that the thousands of new sellers joining weekly can sell successfully without degrading the buyer experience, while preventing bad actors from gaining distribution or abusing incentives.\n\n - Building platform intelligence: Powering accurate seller identification (e.g., enrichment data, signals, and predictive LTV models) to route sellers to the right onboarding, incentive, and discovery paths.\n\n - Creating scalable infrastructure: Partnering with Data Science and Trust teams to design reusable trust and reputation systems, modular fraud prevention frameworks, and experimentation platforms that other pods and teams across Whatnot can leverage.\n\n - Driving long-term seller success: Enabling better bucketing of sellers by value and risk profile, ensuring that high-potential sellers are accelerated early, while low-quality or fraudulent sellers are contained before they reach scale.\n\nThis pod works at the intersection of growth, trust, and platform-ization. You\u2019ll be responsible for deeply technical systems (IDV, fraud signal repositories, seller enrichment pipelines, predictive models) that directly influence GMV, seller retention, and buyer trust.
