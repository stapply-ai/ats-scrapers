You'll build and run the partner growth engine, systematically acquiring high-value partners and driving deep engagement that delivers measurable results.\n\nRethink partner operations with AI\n\nLeverage Dust as a transformative tool to revolutionize our partnership operations by automating meeting follow-ups, generating comprehensive account summaries, surfacing actionable partner insights from communications, automating responses from partners and prospects, and streamlining all operational workflows for maximum efficiency.\n\nBuild comprehensive analytics & business intelligence\n\nCreate executive-level dashboards and reporting systems that drive decision-making, implement advanced attribution models, and develop predictive analytics to optimize partner performance and ROI across all partnership channels.\n\nDesign next-generation partner programs\n\nResearch, develop, and launch innovative partnership models with schools, training agencies, or other partners that leverage AI-powered workflows, create competitive differentiation, and establish Dust as a thought leader in partnership strategy within the GenAI space.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - 6+ years of strategic operations experience in B2B SaaS with demonstrated success building and scaling partnership programs, preferably in high-growth environments\n\n - Proven track record of program leadership with experience managing complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives and building systems that scale from startup to enterprise\n\n - Advanced CRM and automation expertise with deep HubSpot knowledge and hands-on experience architecting sophisticated automation workflows (Zapier, Make, or similar platforms)\n\n - Strategic analytical capabilities combined with exceptional cross-functional collaboration skills to influence and align Sales, Operations, Product, and C-level stakeholders\n\n - Executive communication skills with experience presenting to leadership teams and translating complex operational strategies into clear business outcomes\n\n - Preferred: Advanced technical skills including SQL proficiency, experience with BI tools (Looker, Metabase, Tableau), and understanding of API integrations\n\n - Preferred: Partnership program expertise with hands-on experience building channel partnerships, technology alliances, or marketplace strategies at scale\n\n\nLOCATION\n\nWe're prioritizing building our team with an in-person culture at our offices in Paris and San Francisco, valuing the magic that happens when talented people work closely together.\n\n\nWHY DUST\n\nWe're not building yet another enterprise SaaS tool. We\u2019re creating an AI OS that will fundamentally change how companies operate. We believe existing AI models are powerful enough to have a tremendous impact on the world (and will keep getting better) \u2013 the key is building the infrastructure so that they have context and explore the best interfaces for humans to interact with them.\n\nWe have the unique opportunity to explore and shape the way humans interact with machines while working on a product we use ourselves every day.\n\nIf you're excited about crafting products that reinvent B2B software and want to join a team that combines the best of startup culture with the backing of top-tier investors, we'd love to talk.\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Even if you don't check every box in our requirements, we encourage you to apply. We value diverse perspectives and backgrounds, and we're more interested in your potential and passion than a perfect match to our checklist.\n\n___\n\n\nLEARN HOW WE THINK AND WORK.\n\n - Our product constitution https://blog.dust.tt/a-first-version-of-our-product-constitution/\u00a0a story about our mission\n\n - Agents at work - Latent Space https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5wFQOb4eI4, podcast with our cofounder, Stanislas Polu, 2024\n\n - LLMs reasoning and agentic capabilities over time https://youtu.be/8d1PtJBnAEM?feature=shared - dotAI, podcast with our cofounder, Stanislas Polu, 2024", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "20ab3e5a-21e9-412c-8289-420d9530f779", "title": "GTM Engineer", "department": "Sales", "team": "Sales", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Paris", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-10-20T16:02:03.709+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "\u00cele de France", "addressCountry": "France", "addressLocality": "Paris"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/dust/20ab3e5a-21e9-412c-8289-420d9530f779", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/dust/20ab3e5a-21e9-412c-8289-420d9530f779/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>About Dust</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>We're creating a</strong> <strong>new AI operating system that has the potential to change the way companies operate</strong>.
