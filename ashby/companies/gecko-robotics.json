This is not your typical software engineering role. We are on the ground, shoulder to shoulder with our clients - whether it's working on predictive maintenance on US Navy ships, aiding the Air Force or sitting in on a boiler inspection - we are the first line of defense in solving these hard hitting problems. We are not afraid to pick up new technologies and will use whatever tool we have in our toolbox to create change. When our priorities shift, we shift with them. We don\u2019t just speak to our clients about their problems, we travel (often) to their sites to see first hand what they are experiencing. We are impact makers - game changers. We are leveraging data and insight from team members across Gecko to build the best possible solution for our clients. Are you ready to join us?\n\n\nTECHNOLOGIES WE USE\n\n - Python, JavaScript, React\n\n - Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL DO\n\n - Solve Real Problems: We search for the highest impact problems we can find, we spend a lot of time with our customers to understand their true nature, we come up with new ways, and we don\u2019t quit until we\u2019ve reached impact.\u00a0\n\n - Growth: The problems we work on are hard. No one has yet solved them. We are constantly learning and trying - and that includes learning about ourselves. We are a group who loves to grow - even if it requires hard work to do so.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - Bachelor\u2019s degree in fields such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or relevant experience.\n\n - Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n\n - Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you\u2019re building.\n\n - Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n\n - Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.\n\n - Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\n\n - Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\n\n - Willingness and interest to travel as needed up to 50%.\n\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nAt Gecko, our people are our greatest investment. In addition to competitive compensation packages, we offer company equity, 401(k) matching, gender-neutral parental leave, full medical, dental, and vision insurance, mental health and wellness support, ongoing professional development, family planning assistance, and flexible paid time off.\u00a0\n\nGecko values collaboration, innovation, and partnership, and we believe we do our best work when we're together in person. We\u2019re an office-first culture but understand that sometimes you may need to work from home. Many people are in the office five days a week, others need a bit more\u00a0flexibility. Ultimately, we care about the outcomes we achieve - and creating a culture of autonomy and trust that enables that impact.\n\nGecko is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.\u00a0 We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission to protect today\u2019s infrastructure and give form to tomorrow\u2019s. All qualified applicants will be treated with respect and receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, uniform service, veteran status, age, or any other protected characteristic per federal, state, or local law.
