This might involve teaching a technical founder how to sell and take their product to market, or guiding them through making their first key hires.\n\n\nABOUT THE ASSOCIATE RECRUITER ROLE\n\nAssociate Recruiters on the Founder Success team have a mission critical role \u2014 to support founders in hiring their early team members. Founders need to move quickly in making those early technical, GTM, and operations hires and we\u2019re searching for someone to work hand-in-hand with them to find exceptional candidates. As an Associate Recruiter, you will work with 5-6 Founders at a time, building quality candidate pipelines and doing sourcing outreach to help tee up candidate intro calls for our founders.\n\nYou\u2019ll have exposure to some of the most exciting founders and companies on the planet, working side-by-side with the next Uber, Notion or Square founders in their very earliest days. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to build strong relationships with exceptional people and may even join one of the companies you support at some point (we highly encourage that path).\n\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\nSOURCING, OUTREACH, AND COORDINATION - 80%\n\n - Engage in high-volume candidate sourcing for a wide range of roles, encompassing technical and non-technical positions (from founding IC to director-level).\n\n - Continuously refine your sourcing strategies to increase candidate acceptance rate through iterative improvements\n\n - Craft compelling outreach messages to engage candidates and get them excited about the opportunity\n\n - Act as the liaison between candidates and founders, facilitating introductions by coordinating calls with founders, sending reminders, and gathering feedback \u2014 all while ensuring clear and timely communication throughout the process\n\n\nRECRUITING ADVISING - 10%\n\n - Facilitate weekly check-ins with founders to review pipeline health, discuss successes and challenges, and collaborate on action plans.\n\n - Partner closely with founders to refine hiring profiles, including scoping out job roles and designing interview loops\n\n - Provide general recruiting guidance, from compensation/leveling to candidate closing strategies\n\n\nTRACK AND IMPROVE YOUR METRICS - 10%\n\n - Track your sourcing metrics and use data to inform your decisions.

You rarely drop a ball and have a tight system for managing multiple recs at one time\n\n - You're a strong relationship builder, able to build rapport with people from all backgrounds and levels.\n\n - You are creative and gritty.

To give you a sense of what our team is all about, check out our values that guide our work:\n\n - Try harder for founders. They\u2019re our customers \u2014 LPs are our shareholders.\u00a0Going above and beyond for our founders is what we do. We strive to be a founder's most valuable investor. We respond to their emails in hours, not days. We build candidate pipelines, unprompted. We arrange meal deliveries when they become a new parent. Simply put, we go above and beyond to earn that right to be their first call every time there\u2019s a bump in the road.\n\n - Give your unvarnished opinions and unwavering support.\u00a0We strive to be kind, not nice. One of the most (counterintuitively) compassionate things you can do is to offer your unvarnished opinion \u2014 along with your unwavering support. That willingness to risk a fleeting moment of discomfort in exchange for someone else\u2019s growth is long-term kindness.\n\n - Treat the little things like big things.\u00a0Everything can always be made better. We\u2019re all about the carefully crafted, the nitty-gritty, and the bespoke. Whether it\u2019s hand cutting each nameplate, or debating the optimal shape of the dinner table, no detail is too small to sweat.\n\n - Make speed a habit.\u00a0Whatever you\u2019re building, remember that now is better than two weeks from now. We\u2019re fans of starting small and iterating quickly. No matter what we\u2019re launching, you\u2019ll likely hear this question in a meeting: \u201cHow soon can we get something out there?\u201d\n\n - Invent and wander.\u00a0Never stop experimenting. The best ideas are born out of experimentation. Our flagship programs have always come from our penchant for going out on a limb and approaching problems with a different perspective.\n\n - Build wider doorways and longer tables. We're in the business of backing people and betting on their ideas \u2014 no matter where they come from. While talent is evenly distributed, opportunity is not. First Round is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workspace and we encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply!", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$70K \u2013 $90K", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$70K - $90K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "32360276-9829-4b48-b64d-0ea5bc766e04", "tierSummary": "$70K \u2013 $90K", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "26d62552-77bc-4a78-b627-a0b7a2239c92", "summary": "$70K \u2013 $90K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 70000, "maxValue": 90000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 70000, "maxValue": 90000}]}}], "apiVersion": "1"}
