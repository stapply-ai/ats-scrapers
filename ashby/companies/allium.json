Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform.

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/visas-data-partner-allium-labs-raises-165m-as-their-new-findings-show-stablecoin-activity-is-back-up/, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap. Allium is one of the unique companies in the industry that bridge blockchain and non blockchain worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe love engineers who love solving new problems every single day.\n\n - Data Egress - How does one transport 100s of TBs of data around the world without breaking the piggybank? (https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-public-preview-delta-sharing-cloudflare-r2-integration)\n\n - Handle high traffic - How can we support the biggest applications in this industry and allow handle 100,000 QPS at peak traffic and not go down? (https://www.allium.so/post/the-inside-story-of-the-jup-airdrop-at-phantom)\n\n - Botnets - This industry is in its early days, how does one catch botnets based on their behavioral patterns? (https://www.allium.so/post/initial-report-for-the-10-6k-botnet)\n\n - Fraud (Sybil) Detection - Is it possible to transfer the same fraud detection heuristics into this blockchain world? (https://www.allium.so/post/from-eligibility-to-sybil-detection-a-deep-dive-into-wormholes-multichain-airdrop)\n\n - Who is real? - What constitutes meaningful and organic transactions on the blockchain? (https://www.allium.so/post/visa-x-allium-making-sense-of-stablecoins)\n\n - Bring Your Own Transformation - How do we let our customers design their own APIs and transform their own realtime data streams? (https://docs.allium.so/allium-app/explorer-api/quickstart)\n\n - Data Governance - We pride ourselves on our data quality - How can we ensure our data is consistent across every copy and every region 24/7?\n\n - AI and LLMs - How does one design the LLM and AI experience on top of our data to lower the barrier of entry to crypto data? (https://docs.allium.so/allium-app/allium-explorer/allium-ai-assistant)\n\n - Data Transformation Holy grail: How can one unify streaming and batch transformation logic into a single code base?\n\nIf any of those bore you, we have many many more problems we have to solve!\n\n\nALLIUM SIZZLE REEL\n\n\nGIANT INFRASTRUCTURE BUDGET PER HEAD\n\nYou will make mistakes, costly mistakes, but at Allium's expense. We have an internal leaderboard of the costliest infrastructure mistakes made, and we (try to) learn from them. We don't have fancy Michelin-starred meal budgets, but we have a huge infrastructure budget for one to get better at your craft. Why? We leverage every tool (no prereqs) out there because we meet our enterprise customers where they are at:\n\n - Every OLAP: Snowflake, Databricks, Bigquery, Clickhouse*\n\n - Every OLTP: Postgres, Aurora\n\n - Every Event bus: Kafka, SNS, PubSub\n\n - Every Cloud Provider: AWS, GCP, Azure (one day)\n\n - A copy of data in every region: US East, Central, West, Europe, Asia\n\n - Every data transformation and orchestration tool: Apache Beam, Materialize, TinyBird, DBT, SQLMesh, Temporal\n\n - Data governance tools: DataFold\n\n(if any of the names above sound like foreign Pokemon names, fret not, you can come here and catch them all, we are here to teach and make you successful.)\n\n\nDON'T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US (HTTPS://WWW.ALLIUM.SO/BLOG#LOVE) https://www.allium.so/blog#love\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/585a3023-4036-4ec0-af76-ed3198f80890/image.png]\n\n\nWHAT SOME ~COOL PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT US:\n\n - Mario Gabriele from The Generalist's Future 50 Startup List: https://www.allium.so/post/allium-named-awardee-of-the-generalists-inaugural-future-50-startups\n\n - Tomasz Tungus from Theory Ventures: https://tomtunguz.com/allium/\n\n - Bucky Moore from Kleiner Perkins: https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/allium-series-a/\n\n\nOK.. NOW FOR SOME TOUGH LOVE, HERE ARE THE VALUES WE STRIVE FOR AT ALLIUM:\n\n - Pro Athlete Mindset - Consistency. Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow.\u00a0I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (cough Man United fans) of inconsistency\n\n - Figure It Out & Extreme Ownership - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don\u2019t know it, learn it. If you can\u2019t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can\u2019t find someone, find someone who can find someone. It is never lack of resources, but lack of resourcefulness.\n\n - High Agency - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you\u2019re looking for a superpower, you can\u2019t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life\n\n - Leading from the Front - No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It\u2019s one thing to say We need to do XYZ this better & it\u2019s another thing to build an MVP and say \u201cThis is the way we should do things\u201d. The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.\n\n - Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.\n\n - Sense of (allium) business smell - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nWe invite people of all backgrounds (https://www.allium.so/about). We have engineers who learnt coding much later in life, who learnt coding on the side, we have engineers who are still in school and we also have engineers who went to the top schools (CMU, Stanford, UIUC, UPenn, Oxford, NUS, Cornell), all are welcome if one comes in with a curious mind and an infectious work ethic.\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/68e40347-6f06-4fcd-a99a-68f539058433/allium%20team%20montage.jpeg]\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/1d38ca35-e23a-4c10-9a8f-8a79993c8cb3/image.png]\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE BENEFITS\n\nMedical, Dental, Vision, Life and AD&D insurance - US folks get 100% coverage for Gold plans, 80% for dependents\n\nNote: The sun never sets on Allium - we hire from any geographical location as long as you are willing to overlap 2 hours overlap on NYC mornings Mon-Thurs from 10am-12pm ET.

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/visas-data-partner-allium-labs-raises-165m-as-their-new-findings-show-stablecoin-activity-is-back-up/, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap.

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends).

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/visas-data-partner-allium-labs-raises-165m-as-their-new-findings-show-stablecoin-activity-is-back-up/, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap. Allium is one of the unique companies in the industry that bridge blockchain and non blockchain worlds.\n\n\nESSENCE OF THE ROLE\n\n - Identify use cases and prospect teams that need Allium's data platform for accounting, analytics or building applications.\n\n - Develop a book of high potential engaged prospects and maintain a sufficient pipeline to support successful attainment against quota.\n\n - Successfully lead a technical sales motion of guiding engineers, product, and growth team members for the entire life-cycle from prospecting to close.\n\n - Master Allium's data schemas and solutions and evangelize for industry success across fintech, tradfi, crypto exchanges, crypto startups, protocols.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\n - 5+ years of experience in sales, partnerships, or sales within, trad-fi, fintech,or financial services.\u00a0\n\n - Deep knowledge of TradFi infrastructure, including payments systems, banking-as-a-service, capital markets, custody, or settlement processes, with an ability to bridge these to blockchain applications.\n\n - A strong track record of over performance\n\n - Keen sense of smell to seek out customers that can save time and money with our solution\n\n - Work with engineers and analysts collaboratively to win customers\n\n - Building territory plans and execute them to plan\n\n - Passion working with both crypto companies and financial institutions\n\n - Proficiency in technical products, data products and APIs\n\n - Sherlock & Enola Holmes level of curiosity to find peculiarities in the data and help the industry redefine the narratives. (e.g. We have helped Brevan Howard Digital and Nic Carter with their industry-defining Stablecoin Reports)\n\n - Good enough understanding of NFT, DEXs, Decoded Logs, and Smart Contracts to transform the data to the engineers and fulfill customer needs quickly\n\n - Proven enterprise sales expertise, with a history of closing large, complex deals in TradFi or adjacent sectors.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDON'T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US (HTTPS://WWW.ALLIUM.SO/BLOG#LOVE) https://www.allium.so/blog#love\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/585a3023-4036-4ec0-af76-ed3198f80890/image.png]\n\n\nWHAT SOME ~COOL PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT US:\n\n - Mario Gabriele from The Generalist's Future 50 Startup List: https://www.allium.so/post/allium-named-awardee-of-the-generalists-inaugural-future-50-startups\n\n - Tomasz Tungus from Theory Ventures: https://tomtunguz.com/allium/\n\n - Bucky Moore from Kleiner Perkins: https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/allium-series-a/\n\n\nOK..

A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow.\u00a0I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (cough Man United fans) of inconsistency\n\n - Figure It Out & Extreme Ownership - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don\u2019t know it, learn it. If you can\u2019t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can\u2019t find someone, find someone who can find someone. It is never lack of resources, but lack of resourcefulness.\n\n - High Agency - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you\u2019re looking for a superpower, you can\u2019t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life\n\n - Leading from the Front - No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It\u2019s one thing to say We need to do XYZ this better & it\u2019s another thing to build an MVP and say \u201cThis is the way we should do things\u201d. The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.\n\n - Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.\n\n - Sense of (allium) business smell - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nWe invite people of all backgrounds (https://www.allium.so/about).

Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/visas-data-partner-allium-labs-raises-165m-as-their-new-findings-show-stablecoin-activity-is-back-up/, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap. Allium is one of the unique companies in the industry that bridge blockchain and non blockchain worlds.\n\nRole Overview\n\nThe Solutions Engineer at Allium.so http://Allium.so works closely with customers to ensure they get the most value from the entire Allium platform. This role is technical, customer-facing, and involves designing custom solutions to meet specific blockchain data needs.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n - Engage with customers to understand their blockchain data requirements and provide expert guidance on using Allium.so http://Allium.so's platform.\n\n - Design and implement tailored data analytics solutions, such as dashboards for transaction trends or custom reports for blockchain metrics.\n\n - Offer ongoing technical support, troubleshooting issues to ensure smooth platform usage.\n\n - Gather customer feedback to inform product improvements and work with product and engineering teams to prioritize new features.\n\n - Create and maintain documentation for customer implementations to support future operations.\n\nRequirements\n\n - 2-5 years experience in a similar role.\n\n - A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field, with a Master's degree preferred.\n\n - Strong proficiency in programming languages like Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and experience with data analytics tools.\n\n - 2-5 years of experience in data engineering, data analytics, or similar, with a track record of designing customer solutions.\n\n - Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, problem-solving abilities, and project management skills to handle multiple customer projects.\n\n - A solid understanding of blockchain technology and its data structures, with knowledge of data security and privacy best practices as a plus.\n\n\nDON'T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US (HTTPS://WWW.ALLIUM.SO/BLOG#LOVE) https://www.allium.so/blog#love\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/585a3023-4036-4ec0-af76-ed3198f80890/image.png]\n\n\nWHAT SOME ~COOL PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT US:\n\n - Mario Gabriele from The Generalist's Future 50 Startup List: https://www.allium.so/post/allium-named-awardee-of-the-generalists-inaugural-future-50-startups\n\n - Tomasz Tungus from Theory Ventures: https://tomtunguz.com/allium/\n\n - Bucky Moore from Kleiner Perkins: https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/allium-series-a/\n\n\nOK.. NOW FOR SOME TOUGH LOVE, HERE ARE THE VALUES WE STRIVE FOR AT ALLIUM:\n\n - Pro Athlete Mindset - Consistency. Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow.\u00a0I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (cough Man United fans) of inconsistency\n\n - Figure It Out & Extreme Ownership - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don\u2019t know it, learn it. If you can\u2019t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can\u2019t find someone, find someone who can find someone. It is never lack of resources, but lack of resourcefulness.\n\n - High Agency - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you\u2019re looking for a superpower, you can\u2019t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life\n\n - Leading from the Front - No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It\u2019s one thing to say We need to do XYZ this better & it\u2019s another thing to build an MVP and say \u201cThis is the way we should do things\u201d. The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.\n\n - Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.\n\n - Sense of (allium) business smell - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nWe invite people of all backgrounds (https://www.allium.so/about). We have engineers who learnt coding much later in life, who learnt coding on the side, we have engineers who are still in school and we also have engineers who went to the top schools (CMU, Stanford, UIUC, UPenn, Oxford, NUS, Cornell), all are welcome if one comes in with a curious mind and an infectious work ethic.\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/68e40347-6f06-4fcd-a99a-68f539058433/allium%20team%20montage.jpeg]\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/1d38ca35-e23a-4c10-9a8f-8a79993c8cb3/image.png]\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE BENEFITS\n\nMedical, Dental, Vision, Life and AD&D insurance - US folks get 100% coverage for Gold plans, 80% for dependents\n\nNote: The sun never sets on Allium - we hire from any geographical location as long as you are willing to overlap 2 hours overlap on NYC mornings Mon-Thurs from 10am-12pm ET.

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data.

Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform.

Bonus points for the right pronunciation. </em></p>", "descriptionPlain": "ALLIUM MAKES BLOCKCHAIN DATA ACCURATE, SIMPLE AND FAST\n\n\nBLOCKCHAIN DATA IS HARD, MESSY, AND CHAOTIC\n\nWhen we started out in late 2021 our thesis was simple - blockchain data, despite it being public and free, was difficult to understand, clunky to access and troublesome to maintain. Answering a simple question like \u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.\n\n\nACCESSING DATA IS HARD BECAUSE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR WRITES AND NOT READS\n\nWhy is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.\n\n\nPARSING AND INTERPRETING BLOCKCHAIN DATA REQUIRES BOTH DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND DATA MANIPULATION\n\nTo quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, \u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668 \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.\n\n\nALLIUM ABSTRACTS THE COMPLEXITY WITH A SIMPLE WAY TO QUERY BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nAllium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 100+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.\n\n\nGOOGLE AND BLOOMBERG HAD TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD'S PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND WEBPAGE DATA, ALLIUM IS ON A MISSION TO DO THE SAME FOR BLOCKCHAIN DATA\n\nThis is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:\n\n\nABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/visas-data-partner-allium-labs-raises-165m-as-their-new-findings-show-stablecoin-activity-is-back-up/, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap. Allium is one of the unique companies in the industry that bridge blockchain and non blockchain worlds.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAllium is seeking a Research Analyst to transform blockchain data into actionable insights. You will work closely with our team of data scientists, engineers, and business stakeholders to develop, build, and maintain dashboards, reports, and content that drive strategic decision-making and conversations across the largest institutions & companies in the industry. Shape how the crypto community and institutions interpret on-chain activity, while learning from leading blockchain data engineers and analysts.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Develop blockchain analytics - Build, maintain, & optimize queries (SQL) and insights from massive multi-chain datasets\n\n - Build research dashboards & reports - Design and maintain dashboards and visual reports that drive strategic decision-making\n\n - Produce concise market updates and research - Analyze institutional trends (e.g. stablecoins, tokenized assets, onchain finance), protocol mechanics, market structure, and major crypto events.\n\n - Shape the narrative for the industry - Write compelling data-driven content (blogs, social media posts, research reports) to build Allium\u2019s brand and your personal brand to become an authoritative voice to the largest industry players\n\n - Cross-functional scaling - Collaborate with sales, marketing, and product/engineering to distribute insights, provide product feedback, and highlight Allium\u2019s data stack\n   \n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - Crypto-native - You deeply understand crypto concepts and are always tracking emerging trends\n\n - Strong proficiency in SQL and data - Able to write complex queries (joins, grouping, CTEs, window functions) and optimize for performance / UX\n\n - Natural data storyteller - You use the numbers to build a compelling narrative vs. having numbers for their own sake. You turn complex data into clear, shareable insights. You have an opinionated view backed by data, and tie back to why people should care\n\n - You are an owner - You are proactive, responsible and adaptable. You take pride in your work and take responsibility for your decisions, and also respect others with theirs. You have excellent attention to detail, organizational skills, and meet deadlines all while operating in a highly ambiguous and fast-changing environment. You want to build your personal brand and are confident staking your reputation on the quality of your work\n\n - You are a doer - You get stuff done, and move with unusual urgency, take pride in continual improvement, and iteratively integrate feedback.\n\n - You have high integrity - You uphold the highest standards of discretion and integrity. You'll be entrusted with a range of confidential information, from customer information to company financial details.\n\n - Institutional background / understanding is a major plus\n\n\nMORE SPECIFIC PAST WORK ALLIUM HAS DONE:\n\n - Visa's stablecoin dashboard: https://visaonchainanalytics.com/\n\n - Visa x Allium stablecoin lending whitepaper: https://corporate.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/corporate/solutions/documents/stablecoins-beyond-payments-onchain-lending-opportunity.pdf\n\n - Diving deep into the guts of Ordinals data to power research like this: https://x.com/0xren_cf/status/1813606266553446596\n\n - Sybil Detection (https://www.allium.so/post/from-eligibility-to-sybil-detection-a-deep-dive-into-wormholes-multichain-airdrop)\n\n - Powering Brevan Howard Digital's stablecoin industry reports https://mirror.xyz/0x63F8A82711ECA999D5Cf588d5b7afE4DB673C7ED/ekt7LwxhuqZ4t1q5CN1oOHR3nlQGglMpaCB3ZBu2B3Y\n\n - Designing the most intuitive DEX schemas for ALL DeFi researchers to use easily (https://www.allium.so/post/announcing-v3-polars-the-dex-analytics-portal-sponsored-by-the-uniswap-foundation)\n\n - Ensure Grayscale's State of Ethereum Report had the right staking and fees data: (https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/the-state-of-ethereum) https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/the-state-of-ethereum\n\n - Design chain level metrics (Fees, Activity..) for all chains: (https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/chain-metrics)\n\n - Hunt down and curate wallet entities and labels (https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/identity)\n\n - Account abstraction - Ensure we have all the right decoded logs https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/supported-blockchains/evm/ethereum/decoded/decoded-logs to power https://www.bundlebear.com/overview/all\n\n\n\n\n\nDON'T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US (HTTPS://WWW.ALLIUM.SO/BLOG#LOVE) https://www.allium.so/blog#love\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/2f62de56-0dd0-4792-90f8-069c5cb51068/585a3023-4036-4ec0-af76-ed3198f80890/image.png]\n\n\nWHAT SOME ~COOL PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT US:\n\n - Mario Gabriele from The Generalist's Future 50 Startup List: https://www.allium.so/post/allium-named-awardee-of-the-generalists-inaugural-future-50-startups\n\n - Tomasz Tungus from Theory Ventures: https://tomtunguz.com/allium/\n\n - Bucky Moore from Kleiner Perkins: https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/allium-series-a/\n\n\nOK..
