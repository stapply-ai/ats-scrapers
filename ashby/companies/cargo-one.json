If you're familiar with the Scrum guide or have been part of an efficient Scrum team, you'll resonate with our working style. We hope you'll embody our core values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.\n\nAt our core, we believe in a harmonious blend of diligent work, continuous feedback, and the right amount of fun. Ready to join us and revolutionize how airlines handle cargo?\n\n\ud83c\udf0d You can work from (almost) anywhere in Europe and South Africa. Please check here https://www.cargo.one/careers#locations if the country you are in is on our hiring list. We are a remote company, but regularly meet in person, too.\n\n\ud83c\udfac A snapshot of what you will be doing here:\n\n - You will work with technologies like Python 3, Flask, Javascript, Vue.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis. We run a service-oriented architecture with synchronous gRPC endpoints and Celery for asynchronous workloads. All of it runs in Kubernetes clusters deployed in Google Cloud Platform.\n\n - We aim to have continuous deployment pipelines and code that goes into production extremely fast. We can deploy several times daily today, but a few manual steps are still involved. We are constantly expanding our automated tests and refining log messages, metrics, distributed tracing, and alerts to move closer to the desired level of automation and observability.\n\n - We are actively exploring how LLMs are changing our day-to-day work as software engineers. Our baseline expectation is that you are excited about the prospect to delegate tedious, repetitive work to an LLM and find more utility through tools like Cursor or Claude Code to have more focus on all the things that require a human touch.\n\n - We are constantly thinking about our users. There are lots of people in the organization who are even closer to them, from customer service agents to account managers and of course our product team. Nonetheless, it is our job to ask \u201cwhy?\u201d a lot, challenge assumptions, and bring our unique perspective as software engineers to the table.\n\n - We want to enable our co-workers to do their jobs as effectively as possible, so we are regularly building and extending self-service tools for the different roles in the organization. While we have already covered quite a bit of ground on this front, there is still a lot to build. In the meantime, as engineers, we provide hands-on support to ensure our users have an awesome experience.\n\n - We thrive on proactivity. Everyone is encouraged to share knowledge, offer constructive feedback, uplift colleagues, and step up with leadership qualities when the team requires it most.\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We are looking for individuals with:\n\n - We're seeking passionate individuals with at least 5 years of relevant experience. We value what you've learned and achieved during your time in the field.\n\n - Our ideal candidate is someone curious about building transformative products. We're looking for individuals who empathize with users, are passionate about our mission, and are excited about the chance to reshape an industry.\n\n - Verbal and written communication are key. Even more so in a remote-first environment. We cherish those who actively:\n   \n   - Contribute to and evolve our documentation.\n   \n   - Share their insights, experiences, and novel ideas with the team.\n   \n   - Assist fellow engineers during onboarding and foster a collaborative learning environment.\n\n - Candidates with a strong foundation in Python are especially welcome. Your experience with Python will be a significant asset to our team, and we're particularly keen on candidates who have harnessed its capabilities in previous roles. However, we also value adaptability and the breadth of your technical experience.\n\n - We value a strong knowledge of SQL. Whether you've been hands-on with database operations, crafted efficient queries, or delved into troubleshooting performance issues, we appreciate the diverse ways you've engaged with databases.\u00a0\n\n - Understanding the workings of web applications is also a requirement. This can mean having insights into web architecture, knowing about the flow of requests and responses, and understanding how backend systems integrate with other services. No matter your path of experience, we recognize the unique expertise you contribute.\n\n - We love open, fun, and low-ego team players. Nothing is won if you plow through the tasks you picked but your team struggles to deliver on another aspect of the sprint.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f We think you will love working here if:\n\n - You treasure building deep, trusting relationships with your team and managers.\n\n - Innovation excites you, and you\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance processes, starting small and climbing your way up to the architecture.\n\n - Remote work is not just a convenience; it's a dynamic challenge you're eager to navigate and crack open.\n\n - Ownership, commitment, and the joy of exceeding expectations define your work ethic.\n\n - Personal growth is paramount, and you're not afraid to step out of your comfort zone.\n\n - Feedback is a two-way street for you; you believe in giving as much as you take.\n\n - Voicing well-informed opinions, backed by data, is second nature to you.\n\n\n\u2728 WE ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS GLOBALLY:\n\n - Company-wide:\n   \n   - Home office budget of \u20ac650 which can be used to purchase items such as a desk, chair, mouse, keyboard & monitor, etc. in addition to the laptop that we will have delivered to you prior to your starting date.\n   \n   - Offsite fun & team trips since there\u2019s nothing more important than culture and team spirit. We meet twice a year as a company and also have opportunities to\u00a0 meet as a team. Click here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfL4JpPvWgM to watch a video from one of our early offsite events.\n   \n   - Unlimited co-working options through our partner desana https://desana.io/ all around the world.\n   \n   - 24 paid vacation days on top of the bank holidays (specific to the country you are in) and special leaves.\n\n - Engineering-specific:\n   \n   - A full IntelliJ PyCharm license to elevate your Python development.\n   \n   - Prefer another tool like Visual Studio Code or Neovim? No problem, we are not strict about this.\n   \n   - AI assistants that support you. Currently we are running with Cursor, Claude Code and GitHub's Co-Pilot. As our understanding around LLMs and how to utilize them best evolves, so will this list.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 What is so exciting about working in the air cargo industry?\n\nImagine a world without a Skyscanner or Kayak when trying to book your next holiday.
