The Billing Representative (BR) is responsible for ensuring that the assigned workplaces pay their invoices quickly and on time. Cash is the lifeline of any company. This is a very critical role to ensure that the cash flows for the company are smooth. The BR will reach out to the workplaces through phone and email to follow up on payments, get a commitment of payment (\"promise to pay\"), and ensure that the workplaces honor these commitments. The BR will work with the workplaces and the respective internal teams to ensure any roadblocks in collecting the payments are removed.

Recycle: Fire yourself from the vertical and repeat 1-3 on a net new opportunity.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve separated out the last phase of a vertical\u2019s growth into a set of other distinct roles. Vertical Launchers are not expected to take a line of business to $10M+ annualized GSV:\n\n 1. 10\u2192\u221e: Launch new geos. Build and execute on a portfolio of investments to make the customer experience unreasonably good. Scale our demand and supply generation systems. Defect-hunt our own execution in every corner of the business.\n\nWe encourage you to apply if you have:\n\n - Bottomless grit\n\n - Deep empathy\n\n - Endless curiosity\n\n - An ability to turn chaos into order\n\nFor those who get excited by the idea of building something out of nothing, we think being a Vertical Launcher is the ideal role.\n\n - Enjoy extreme ownership over what will hopefully become a large business that delivers an excellent experience to customers. Work on one of the company's primary growth objectives over the next 5+ years.\u00a0\n\n - Get reps being fast and scrappy in a culture that applauds & rewards creative solutions and crazy ideas, and has a large taste for well-considered risks. Learn through osmosis alongside an excellent team that will push you to perform your best.\n\n - Have the backing of a $1.3B-valued company and all of its resources.\n\n\nBENEFITS:\n\n - Do great work that matters for customers who could really use your help.\n\n - Move at the speed of your thinking.\u00a0\n\n - Zero commute. Work wherever you are, globally (but on or around US Pacific Time hours)\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS:\n\n 1.
