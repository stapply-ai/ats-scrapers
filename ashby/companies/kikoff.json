Operating like a startup within the company - fast-moving, experimental, and deeply aligned with Kikoff\u2019s broader mission, this team blends deep platform engineering with 0 to 1 product execution. The team is responsible for Kikoff\u2019s app factory, the foundations that enable rapid app creation and experimentation, while simultaneously using it to build, test, and refine new product ideas that will define Kikoff\u2019s next chapter.\n\nWe are looking for a Senior Software Engineer who is excited to build from zero, driving both product and platform outcomes. You\u2019ll:\n\n - Architect and ship the first version of a new 0 to 1 product - from concept to launch.\n\n - Design and own reusable systems, growth tooling, and experimentation infrastructure that accelerate iteration across this and future Kikoff verticals.\n\n - Balance speed with foundation - knowing when to move fast to learn, and when to invest in the right abstractions to scale.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to incubate new businesses within a fast-growing fintech, while building the technical backbone that will power Kikoff\u2019s next generation of products. If you thrive on blank-canvas building, love solving ambiguous problems, and care equally about building things right and getting things into users\u2019 hands fast, you\u2019ll fit right in.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing\n\n - Design and implement core APIs, growth automation services, and backend systems that power new product verticals.\n\n - Build flexible, scalable Rails architectures that balance iteration speed with long-term maintainability.\n\n - Build flexible, reusable microservices shared across Kikoff\u2019s product ecosystem\n\n - Partner with product and data to set up experimentation infrastructure, metrics pipelines, and event tracking.\n\n - Own end-to-end integrations and services that make new products possible.\n\n - Contribute to internal tooling and shared libraries that improve developer productivity and system observability.\n\n - Help define Kikoff\u2019s backend platform strategy - enabling future 0 to 1 initiatives to spin up faster and safer.\n\nWhat we\u2019re looking for\n\n - 4+ years of experience building and scaling production systems, ideally in Ruby on Rails.\n\n - Solid grasp of system design, API development, and data modeling.\n\n - Comfort working across the stack and collaborating closely with mobile and product teams.\n\n - Excited by fast iteration, ownership, and helping shape platform foundations for future products.\n\n - Experience balancing iteration speed with clean architecture and testing discipline.\n\n - Strong product sense - you care about the \u201cwhy\u201d behind features as much as the \u201chow.\u201d\n\n - Entrepreneurial mindset - thrives in ambiguity, takes initiative, and loves turning ideas into working systems.\n\nKikoff: A FinTech Unicorn Powering Financial Progress with AI\nAt Kikoff, our mission is to provide radically affordable financial tools to help consumers achieve financial security.
