Shell scripting, CUDA C++ are a plus.\n\n - Excellent written and verbal communication skills.\n\n - Strong ability to work independently and collaboratively in a team.\n\n - Willingness to put in the hard work needed to bring our SPU to life.\n\n - Above all: zero ego.\n\nAs passionate scientists and engineers, we are well aware of the plethora of critical problems in the world that cannot be solved because humanity simply does not have enough computing power. To address this, Vorticity is developing a radically new silicon chip architecture and system to dramatically accelerate scientific computing problems.\n\nVorticity\u2019s mission is to expand human ingenuity. To do that we are building a team of exceptional people to work together on big problems.
