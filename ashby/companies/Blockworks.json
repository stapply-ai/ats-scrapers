You have a results-oriented attitude and a passion for delivering flawless releases and developing digital data pipelines. You have a proven track record facilitating engineering teams to increase productivity and quality.\n\nYou're excited at the possibility of helping design and develop our data pipelines as well as leading leading our Solana data-related projects and strategies. You love moving quickly in a fast-paced start-up, but you also bring intentionality, sustainability and scalability to your approach as an engineer.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO:\n\nAs our Senior Data Engineer, you will be directly responsible for leading the creation and execution of our data models and strategies that feed our product. You'll work collaboratively with other members of the engineering team to design, develop, implement, and evolve our data pipeline and approaches.\n\nEvery day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:\n\n - Own Data Sourcing Pipelines: You'll be responsible for helping to architect our data warehousing, ingestion and sourcing strategy, working with multiple SDKs to aggregate data from various sources into Blockwork's own data warehouse.\n\n - Design and Implement ETL Solutions: You'll be responsible for implementing our overall ETL approach, including accessing & setting up blockchain nodes to pull from, sourcing data from 3rd parties, and modeling our internal schemas across our PostgreSQL database(s)\n\n - Grow Shared Knowledge: You'll help provide technical leadership, guidance, and assistance to the team in the implementation of established architectures and designs.\n\n - Drive Operational Efficiency: You'll be constantly looking for opportunities to improve data workflows and reliably automate routine tasks.\n\n - Cross-Functional Collaboration: You'll work with other teams across Blockworks, including Research, Product, and Engineering, to lead initiatives and move collaborations forward.\n\nExperimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019VE DONE BEFORE:\n\nFor this role, first and foremost, you must have significant knowledge of the crypto industry; interest in crypto is not enough, we\u2019re looking for someone who considers themself crypto native. You have at least 4 (but ideally more) years of hands-on experience with data modeling, schema design, data operations, and data warehousing. During that time, you've personally built backend systems at scale with a focus on data processing and ingestion. You're an ace at Typescript, Go, and/or Python, and you bring incredibly strong expertise in SQL (ideally Postgres, dbt, and Hypertables). You have deep experience creating data warehouses using Timescale, Snowflake, and/or BigQuery, and you also bring experience using DevOps tools and solutions like Docker, CI/CD, and AWS.\n\n\nIT\u2019D BE GREAT IF YOU\u2019VE DONE THIS:\n\nExperience and demonstrated success in crypto, web3, startup, or incubator environments will move you to the top of the list. A background in designing, building, and managing microservices will also set you apart, especially if you bring expertise in security, privacy, and scalability. We\u2019re especially interested in candidates who can pair technical depth with an ability to thrive in high-growth, fast-paced settings.\n\nWhat will truly make you stand out is hands-on experience with Solana. If you\u2019ve built and operated Solana ingestion pipelines using RPC, Websocket, or Geyser with resilience to forks and automated backfills, you\u2019ll be a huge asset to our team. We\u2019re looking for engineers who can decode transactions, instructions, and events, and ship modeled data into Postgres, Clickhouse, or Parquet with speed and accuracy. Fluency in decoding native programs such as System, Stake, SPL Token, Token2022, and Memo, along with Anchor programs, while managing IDLs, Borsh layouts, and maintaining an internal decoder registry, would set you apart as a Solana expert.\n\n\nSALARY, BENEFITS, & HOW WE WORK:\n\nThis is a full time exempt position with an expected salary of $160,000 - $200,000/year.\n\n\nBENEFITS:\n\nRemote-First:\n\nWe're a remote-first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please.\n\n100% Medical Coverage for You:\n\nClose to fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you, and a significant portion covered for your dependents.\n\nFlexible PTO:\n\nWe have a flexible paid time off policy that doesn't limit the number of vacation days you can take.\n\nParental Leave:\n\nAt Blockworks, all team members are eligible for 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave.\n\nHardware Stipend:\n\nEvery team member has a stipend to use to purchase the tools and technology that help them be their most productive.\n\nLearning & Growth Stipend:\n\nEvery team member has a stipend to spend on their skill growth and professional development.\n\nCareer Growth:\n\nWe prioritize skill growth and career development, and we have a clear, documented structure to take the guesswork out of individual development and career progression\n\nGlobal & Diverse Team:\n\nWe're a global team, and we're committed to creating an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture\n\n\nCOME BUILD WITH US; WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED!\n\nWe know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking.
