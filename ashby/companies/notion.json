Working alongside passionate experts across design, product, and data, you'll help shape the future of how people work.\n\nWe\u2019re hiring early career engineers to join us across several teams at Notion. Your recruiter will partner with you to find the team that best aligns with your interests and where you can make the highest impact.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL ACHIEVE\n\n - Plan, build, and ship product features from conception to launch, then iterate based on insights and user feedback.\n\n - Improve performance, reliability, and quality of key experiences used by millions of users and thousands of organizations.\n\n - Run experiments that drive activation, retention, collaboration, and revenue, partnering with design, data science, and research.\n\n - Build internal tools and platform improvements that help all engineers ship quickly and safely.\n\n - Contribute to team norms, code quality, and a culture of learning and thoughtful tradeoffs.\n\n\nAREAS YOU MIGHT WORK ON\n\n - Core Notion product features: Help develop, improve, and maintain features for our flagship product, focusing on the editor, databases, sharing, or other key areas that power millions of workflows.\n\n - AI and automation: Help develop and integrate intelligent features that make Notion more powerful, contextual, and efficient for our users.\n\n - Growth and activation: Work on features that help new users discover Notion's value, improve onboarding experiences, and increase user engagement.\n\n - Platform and infrastructure: Contribute to the systems that power Notion's backend services, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance as our user base grows.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU\u2019LL BRING\n\n - Proven track record of execution: You have a minimum of 1 year (and up to 3 years) of full-time professional engineering experience, including building world-class product experiences as part of an engineering team.

You can navigate ambiguity successfully, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you\u2019re building.\n\n - Impact-driven approach to technology: You see technologies as tools to achieve user impact rather than ends in themselves. You care more about building successful systems that solve real problems than about using specific tech stacks or following trends. You stay current with the latest tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI-assisted development environments, you're pragmatic about choosing the right tool for the job, focusing on what delivers the most value to users and the business.\n\n - Proactive communication and high agency: You own your work, communicating clearly about progress and blockers.

This includes creating event checklists, standardizing follow-up communications, and following operational best practices so the whole team can contribute to our events program\n\n - Help sales teams follow up thoughtfully: Give them insights about who attended, what they cared about, and how to continue the conversation\n\n\nSKILLS YOU'LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - 3-5 years creating marketing programs that actually drive business results, ideally in B2B software\n\n - Excellent writing and strong communication skills. You can write event descriptions that make people want to register and create presentations that hold attention\n\n - Content marketing expertise with AI thought leadership focus: You understand how to create compelling top-of-funnel content that positions Notion as a serious business solution. Experience developing thought leadership around AI's impact on the workplace, productivity tools, and the future of work.\n\n - Experience running webinars, demos, or virtual events that people genuinely wanted to attend\n\n - Strong project management instincts\u2014you can keep multiple programs moving without dropping details\n\n - Analytical thinking: you want to understand what's working and why, not just celebrate vanity metrics\n\n - Experience working with sales and product teams to create things together\n\n - Product-led growth (PLG) experience is a big plus\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES:\n\n - You use Notion and understand why people get excited about it\n\n - Experience with Salesforce and how leads actually move through sales processes\n\n - Some experience with video production or content creation\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.
