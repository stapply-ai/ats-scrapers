Read this article https://blog.alan.com/tech-et-produit/engineering-organisation-at-alan if you want to discover how life as an Engineer at Alan and this article https://medium.com/alan/engineering-career-path-at-alan-e5de5c2e740c on our Engineering career path.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf10 ENABLING GLOBAL-FIRST PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn Alan's early expansion https://medium.com/alan/an-unexpected-journey-the-tale-of-the-backend-architecture-at-alan-ac8c5382df60, we made a strategic decision to create separate codebases for each country we ventured into. This approach allowed us to quickly adapt and tailor our applications to meet the unique healthcare and regulatory requirements of France, Belgium, Spain, and Canada.\n\nIn 2024 https://medium.com/alan/engineering-challenges-at-alan-in-2024-686688f6b89d, we reached a crucial point where it was essential to merge these codebases into global, configurable modules. Yet, writing local code is still easier than building global solutions. The Global Architecture team is central to this transformation \u2014 our goal is to enable any team at Alan to develop and launch features seamlessly across markets, as outlined in our 2025 technical strategy https://medium.com/alan/alans-2025-technical-strategy-building-tomorrow-s-stack-today-a070bcb345a6.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Your mission\n\n - Design Cross-Cutting Modules You'll transform country-specific implementations into elegant global components that will become the new building blocks of other teams to build global features\n\n - Remove Technical Blockers for Product Teams You\u2019ll tackle technical blockers that cut across several domains and eliminate the need for team-specific workarounds, allowing product teams to focus on their core business\n\n - Orchestrate Data Transformations You'll implement strategies to harmonize different countries' data models without losing local flexibility and consolidate existing data into unified schemas\n\n - Build and Own What You Create You'll be responsible for the entire lifecycle of your solutions, from initial design through long-term maintenance. We don't just design \u2014 we build, deploy, and maintain what we create\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Why This Role Matters\n\n - Focus on High-Impact, Cross-Domain Solutions You work exclusively on blockers that span multiple business domains that are heavily depended upon. This means every solution you build has an impact across multiple teams\n\n - Enable Teams, Don't Replace Them Your job isn't to substitute other teams or globalize everything. Instead, you'll work on technical obstacles that prevent teams from building global-first solutions and work with them to remove those obstacles\n\n - Learn and Share Globalization Patterns As you design and implement global solutions, you'll develop an expertise in globalization patterns. You'll share these learnings with other teams, helping them make better decisions about global vs. local solutions in their own work\n\n\ud83d\ude80 What we're looking for\n\n - You write code and maintain what you build. At Alan there is no architect in an ivory tower, we implement what we design\n\n - You\u2019re able to navigate complex systems spanning multiple business domains and technical boundaries\n\n - You've worked with diverse architectural patterns and can articulate the nuanced trade-offs between them\n\n - You can spot technical obstacles that are blocking multiple teams and design solutions that remove those obstacles\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2b50 IS IT YOU WE\u2019RE LOOKING FOR?\n\nWe are looking for problem-solver engineers with 5+ years of experience who get excited about simplifying complex business problems:\n\n - You\u2019ll be able to tackle high-impact & high-risk projects involving many engineers.\n\n - You\u2019ll design efficient systems and engineering practices to align with and facilitate interactions between multiple teams/products.\n\n - You\u2019ll have the opportunity to mentor other engineers & lead crews (more details in this article https://blog.alan.com/tech-et-produit/engineering-organisation-at-alan).\n\n - You\u2019ll be able to contribute to hiring your future coworkers and shape candidates\u2019 hiring experience (improving our technical assessment process etc...)\n\nYou would be a good fit at Alan if most of this sounds like you:\n\n - Well-versed in Object Oriented Programming such as Python, Java, C#, and enthusiastic about web technologies such as modern Javascript.\n\n - Willing to work in Python/JavaScript (but you don\u2019t need to have experience with those 2 languages!).\n\n - Passionate about building products.\n\n - Self-starting and entrepreneurial.\n\n - Humble and still willing to grow (no matter your seniority!).\n\n - Collaborative, enthusiastic about teamwork, learning, and teaching.\n\n - Fluent in English (no need to speak French!).\n\nFor this opportunity, we are aiming to hire within the D-F level range.\n\nBut above all, we are looking for high potential and curiosity: make sure to show us this when you apply! Everything else is a bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\u00a0 \u00a0PERKS & BENEFITS https://alan.com/en/careers/a/salary-equity\n\nAt Alan, we believe that being in good health is a basic need, and it starts with our employees.

The ability to understand what can make a business great (product wise, commercially, in terms of image, etc.), and make correct decisions, even in the presence of ambiguity, is paramount.\n\n - Execution and collaboration: given the scope, volume and timeline of work, the ability to direct people\u2014including oneself\u2014towards a particular objective that may require active orchestration is key.\n\n - Versatility: given the scope of work, FAs should be able to jump from one topic to another with similar impact\n\n - Organization, time management and autonomy: you are well-versed in missions requiring precision and reliability. You are able to manage a project from start to finish with minimal external assistance.\u00a0\n\n - Communicate effectively: given the number of Alaners that FAs interact with on a daily basis, the ability to communicate your specific needs (deadlines etc) and to inspire action in others is essential.\u00a0\n\n - Always looking for the extra-mile: as a FA, you will be expected to be able to deliver quickly and well on the tasks assigned to you, but also to be proactive in proposing new initiatives, going beyond the task assigned to you if you think it is necessary, as well as anticipating future needs to propose potential solutions?\n\n - Growth mindset: you know how to ask for and receive feedback in order to grow as an FA in your early professional life.\u00a0\n\n - Fluency in spoken and written English. All our communications are written and in English.\n\n - Technical aptitude: Familiarity and appetite for basic programming,\u00a0 experience with data analysis and/or product creation tools is a plus.\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome applications from candidates with diverse educational backgrounds, including but not limited to:\n\n - Business schools (HEC, ESSEC, ESCP, LSE \u2026)\n\n - Engineering schools (Polytechnique, Mines Paris, Ecole des Ponts, CentraleSupelec, Imperial \u2026 )\n\n - Data science or mathematics programs\n\n - Other relevant fields or schools (Bocconi, Politecnico, TU Delft, UCL, Oxford, Cambridge)\n\nDiplomas matter to an extent but if you don\u2019t have one and have built a project or a company, we\u2019d love to hear from you so please send your application!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude4c \u00a0 PERKS & BENEFITS https://alan.com/about/life-at-alan/a/perks\n\n\nAt Alan, we believe that being in good health is a basic need, and it starts with our employees.
