This team is at the heart of our engineering ecosystem, driving the overall testing strategy and ensuring a high-quality experience across our algorithms, infrastructure, and applications. As part of the developer experience family, you'll collaborate with teams across product, research and platform engineering, leveraging a wealth of knowledge and best practices.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We cultivate a strong quality-first culture, where every team member is empowered to advocate for customer experience improvements. Our agile teams promote close collaboration, and as a QA Engineering Manager, you will be instrumental in fostering this collaborative environment. You'll not only lead your team in shaping our test automation frameworks and tooling but also play a key role in building a strong community within the QA craft. This role offers unique opportunities to drive quality across the full technology stack, working collaboratively with various stakeholders to deliver exceptional customer experiences.</p><h1><strong>Your responsibilities</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The core purpose of the Engineering Manager role is to develop an engineering team to an autonomous, high performing stage:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Delivery &amp; Excellence: </strong>Collaborate with stakeholders, representing the team's quality perspective on new or existing services and products, focusing on testability and automation potential. Align roadmaps with priorities, ensure new features enable timely delivery with integrated testing, and establish high-level engineering excellence metrics for automated quality. Provide strong technical oversight by resolving complex automation challenges, participating in test framework design, and driving robust test automation strategies. Drive continuous improvement of DeepL, practices, and technology, emphasizing increased test automation coverage and efficiency for high-pace, high-quality delivery.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>People Leadership: </strong>Inspire, develop, recruit, and motivate a cross-functional quality engineering &amp; automation team. Conduct regular 1:1s with team members, set individual development or improvement plans, and foster a healthy, non-retaliatory feedback culture within the team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Team Management: </strong>As a collaborative partner with other engineering leads, jointly oversee the team\u2019s strategy, quarterly goals, and business-technical metrics. Ensure the team's development process methodology is optimal, actively participate in building and maintaining the technical roadmap, and take ownership of technical incident management. Dedicate time and resources to quality efforts, maintain a current knowledge base and documentation for the team's services and artifacts, and coordinate resource planning in collaboration with the DevEx track lead and track Leads as needed.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Manage growth: </strong>You derive satisfaction from navigating change and collaboratively discovering innovative solutions with your team and various stakeholders within a dynamic and evolving environment.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Strategic Leadership:</strong> Responsibility includes guiding the strategic direction of the team's engagements and collaborating with stakeholders on the overall DeepL testing strategy. Not directly hands-on in delivering, the role necessitates an understanding and ability to translate business needs into clear, actionable testing requirements for engineers. A profound understanding of technical architecture, potential challenges, and aligning the team's work with broader organizational goals.</p></li></ul><h1><strong>A day in the life</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an Engineering Manager for the QA Developer Experience team, shaping the overall testing strategy and driving a significant shift towards automation. Your mornings will involve collaborating with product and engineering leaders to define comprehensive testing strategies and roadmaps, ensuring alignment with organizational goals for quality and speed. You'll oversee the ownership, development, and evolution of our core testing frameworks and tooling, identifying opportunities to enhance developer experience and maximize automation.

This team is at the heart of our engineering ecosystem, driving the overall testing strategy and ensuring a high-quality experience across our algorithms, infrastructure, and applications. As part of the developer experience family, you'll collaborate with teams across product, research and platform engineering, leveraging a wealth of knowledge and best practices.\n\nWe cultivate a strong quality-first culture, where every team member is empowered to advocate for customer experience improvements. Our agile teams promote close collaboration, and as a QA Engineering Manager, you will be instrumental in fostering this collaborative environment. You'll not only lead your team in shaping our test automation frameworks and tooling but also play a key role in building a strong community within the QA craft. This role offers unique opportunities to drive quality across the full technology stack, working collaboratively with various stakeholders to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n\n\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe core purpose of the Engineering Manager role is to develop an engineering team to an autonomous, high performing stage:\n\n - Delivery & Excellence: Collaborate with stakeholders, representing the team's quality perspective on new or existing services and products, focusing on testability and automation potential. Align roadmaps with priorities, ensure new features enable timely delivery with integrated testing, and establish high-level engineering excellence metrics for automated quality. Provide strong technical oversight by resolving complex automation challenges, participating in test framework design, and driving robust test automation strategies. Drive continuous improvement of DeepL, practices, and technology, emphasizing increased test automation coverage and efficiency for high-pace, high-quality delivery.\n\n - People Leadership: Inspire, develop, recruit, and motivate a cross-functional quality engineering & automation team.
