This is a high-ownership role focused on core systems architecture, backend infrastructure, and product logic. We're solving one of the most complex and high-stakes problems in tech: helping extraordinary people navigate a broken immigration system using software, not spreadsheets.\n\nYou\u2019ll work directly with our founders, attorneys, and AI researchers to architect the systems that power Casium. If you\u2019ve ever thought, \u201cwhy does this still work like it\u2019s 1998?\u201d when working with an employer to file for a visa or dealing with legal software, we feel you, and we\u2019re rebuilding it from first principles.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to build foundational tech for an industry that impacts millions of lives but has seen almost no real innovation.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL OWN\n\n - Architect and build our core backend systems: case pipeline logic, customer workflow infra, document storage and versioning, event systems, and compliance safeguards.\n\n - Design a structured schema for immigration petitions, evidence generation, and multi-stakeholder collaboration (clients, lawyers, reviewers, employers).\n\n - Build and scale AI-powered workflows for legal document preparation, expert review, and petition quality control.\n\n - Interface deeply with LLMs, task queues, and decision engines to replace repetitive manual legal work with deterministic and probabilistic automation.\n\n - Collaborate across legal, product, and engineering to turn messy policy and paperwork into clean abstractions that scale.\n\n - Create internal platforms and developer tools to help our team ship high-quality code, faster, safely.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE LOOKING FOR\n\n - 6\u201310+ years of professional software engineering experience with deep backend chops and a generalist mindset.\n\n - Proven experience designing and scaling backend architectures in production (bonus if in regulated or high-trust domains like healthcare, finance, or legal).\n\n - Comfort working with Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy), and Cloud environment such as AWS. We value pragmatism over stack purity.\n\n - Experience building systems that combine human input + AI/ML outputs in reliable, testable ways.\n\n - High agency and a strong product sense, you know when to slow down for correctness and when to ship scrappy.\n\n - Thoughtful communicator. Clear written reasoning and clean architectural thinking matter more here than hot takes or whiteboard ping-pong.\n\n - Startup experience or founder energy - you want to own outcomes, not just ship tickets.\n\n\nWHY CASIUM\n\n - We\u2019re building something that matters. Immigration is deeply broken - opaque, expensive, exclusionary. We help the people who build the future stay in the country legally, and we\u2019re doing it with a full-stack, tech-forward approach.\n\n - The market is huge and underserved. Business immigration is a massive market. We\u2019ve already proven demand with real revenue and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n - We\u2019re early, but de-risked. Casium is backed by the AI2 Incubator, led by experienced operators, and well-funded by top-tier angels and VCs. You\u2019ll get real equity with real upside.\n\n - You\u2019ll shape the company. As a founding engineer, your fingerprints will be on our culture, tech stack, and the company\u2019s trajectory. This is not a backseat role.\n\n - You\u2019ll work on genuinely hard and novel problems - not yet-another CRUD app.\n\n - You\u2019ll join a team of builders. We are ex-Meta, Microsoft, and LegalPad, a founding team that cares deeply about output and impact.\n\n - Access to unique learning opportunities. With the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) Incubator as a co-founder, our team gets access to numerous talks by leading AI researchers/paper authors, knowledge sharing amongst the community of hundreds of engineers working for AI2 companies, and much more. As a part of the multi-disciplinary team, you get to interact with people from very different backgrounds (from legal to AI to software engineers).\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN\u2019T JOIN US\n\n - You need a PM to hand you specs. You won\u2019t get one.\n\n - You want predictable work and tight lanes. We\u2019re still inventing the map.\n\n - You don\u2019t like talking to users or thinking in first principles.\n\n - \u201cFast, high-quality, end-to-end shipping\u201d sounds like a slogan, not a lifestyle.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$150K \u2013 $240K \u2022 Offers Equity", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$150K - $240K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "be5496e4-0763-483b-b1c0-a0b0f4b9fedd", "tierSummary": "$150K \u2013 $240K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "93bbc687-f2b4-49c4-81b6-111ac4b846b1", "summary": "$150K \u2013 $240K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 150000, "maxValue": 240000}, {"id": "2a857c26-25b3-4050-a65b-b33f6f73cdb8", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 150000, "maxValue": 240000}, {"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}}], "apiVersion": "1"}
