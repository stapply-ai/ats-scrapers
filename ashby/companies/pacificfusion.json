In parallel, we are developing the key components required to build affordable fusion systems.\n\nOur plans are ambitious. We have raised over $900M so far from incredible investors, resourcing us to deliver on these plans. We are bringing together the best scientists, engineers, and operators from the fusion community, hard tech industry, and other sectors. We are united by a shared sense of urgency to provide clean power for the world, particularly managing climate change while meeting growing global energy demand. You can read more about us in this letter from our founders https://pacificfusion.com/updates/founders-letter.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe are seeking a highly motivated Pulsed Power Engineer / Scientist to design, build, operate, and advance our pulsed power systems \u2014 the core of our experimental fusion platform.
