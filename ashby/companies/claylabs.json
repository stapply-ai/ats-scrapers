This role is not your classic CSM role \u2014 you will learn about our customers\u2019 business goals and onboard them to Clay in a way that helps them achieve their goals. You will also use product and Clay-enriched data to proactively target customers that need help or are showing readiness for expansion.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Onboarding and Implementation: You will own one of the most important metrics \u2014 how fast our customers launch their first use case and get value from Clay. Through this process you will also have the joy of teaching your customers the ins and outs of Clay and see many lightbulb moments \ud83d\udca1\n\n - Proactive Adoption Plays: You will use data (via Clay!) to proactively reach out to high priority customers on our self-serve plans, offering workshops and help them get more value.\n\n - Drive Expansion: As a result of your great work onboarding and helping customers adopt Clay, you will expand their plans and help them get even more value out of the product over time.\n\n - Build New Programs: This is a brand new role at Clay, and you will have the opportunity to partner with our Head of CX to build new programs for our customers as different needs arise. This is a great opportunity for someone who is passionate about working directly with customers every day, but also enjoys building new processes and teams from 0.5 to 100.\n\n - Impact Our Product Roadmap: As the steward of our customer relationships and a big Clay user yourself, everyone else at the company will want a piece of you! In particular, you will partner closely with our engineering, design and product team to share synthesized customer feedback and work with them to incorporate it in the development of new features.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BRING\n\n - Passion for Clay: This is the #1 most important thing for this role. Loving Clay is easy, but you need to genuinely be Clay\u2019s #1 fangirl or boy to thrive in this position as you will spend a lot of time in the product and be responsible for helping customers feel the same passion you do \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffc \ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc.\n\n - Domain Expertise: You can walk the walk and talk the talk of all things B2B SaaS and go-to-market operations. Major bonus points for prior experience in revops, markops or other go-to-market operator roles in-house or at an agency.\n\n - Customer-Facing Experience: You have worked directly with customers in prior roles in some capacity (doesn\u2019t have to have been through a CSM role).\n\n - Customer Value Obsessed and Revenue Minded: You aren\u2019t afraid to talk about money and expand a customer contract, but you do this in a way that always has a customer\u2019s absolute best interest in mind.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$100K \u2013 $130K \u2022 Offers Equity", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$100K - $130K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "a304484c-d745-48bc-bf6f-ba8819c4977e", "tierSummary": "$100K \u2013 $130K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "7c63f5e3-12b7-43df-9671-1b304be15a96", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "f994fa4e-8215-4372-a1fe-e1625b54361f", "summary": "$100K \u2013 $130K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 100000, "maxValue": 130000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 100000, "maxValue": 130000}]}}, {"id": "a9dd5b9f-065d-42c2-b0b1-6512fd028e21", "title": "Growth Strategy Enablement", "department": "GTM - Ops", "team": "GTM - Ops", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "New York", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-10-17T22:33:05.060+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "NY", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "New York"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/claylabs/a9dd5b9f-065d-42c2-b0b1-6512fd028e21", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/claylabs/a9dd5b9f-065d-42c2-b0b1-6512fd028e21/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h1><strong>About Clay</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.clay.com/\"><u>Clay</u></a> is a creative tool for growth.
