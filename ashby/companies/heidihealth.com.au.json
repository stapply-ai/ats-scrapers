It\u2019s central to translating Heidi\u2019s innovation into differentiated market leadership that drives adoption, shapes perception, and strengthens our category position.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO:\n\nProposition & Positioning\n\n - Own articulation of the AI Care Partner product value proposition across clinician, enterprise, and patient lenses.\n\n - Define segment-specific positioning and messaging architectures that reinforce Heidi\u2019s category leadership.\n\n - Tailor positioning by specialty, buyer type, and geography to ensure clinician-authentic narratives.\n\n - Lead ongoing competitor and category analysis to inform differentiation strategy.\n\n\n\nLaunch Excellence\n\n - Design and run the end-to-end go-to-market process \u2014 from alpha testing to enterprise roll-out.\n\n - Define launch tiers, readiness gates, and success metrics for all product and feature releases.\n\n - Collaborate with Brand, Field and Growth to deliver high-impact launch campaigns and proof assets.\n\n - Operate fluidly across PLG and enterprise motions \u2014 ensuring narratives and launch frameworks scale from clinician self-serve to enterprise sales.\n\n\n\nProduct Quality & Narrative Alignment\n\n - Partner closely with Product to define and enforce market-readiness and quality standards.\n\n - Integrate clinician and enterprise feedback early in the product lifecycle.\n\n - Translate complex AI and clinical capabilities into accessible, compelling value stories.\n\nPackaging & Monetisation\n\n - Partner with Product and RevOps on packaging, pricing, and monetisation strategies that drive adoption and expansion across PLG and enterprise motions.\n\n - Evaluate and refine commercial propositions to maximise ARR and customer lifetime value.\n\n\n\nCompetitive Intelligence & Market Insight\n\n - Build and maintain a live competitive and market-intelligence system.\n\n - Equip Product, Growth, and Sales with actionable insights - message testing, pricing trends, objection handling.\n\n - Advise leadership on category dynamics, analyst perspectives, and market evolution.\n\nAnalyst & Ecosystem Relations\n\n - Build relationships with analysts, KOL clinicians, and ecosystem partners to amplify category awareness and credibility.\n\n - Shape external narratives that position Heidi as the default AI Care Partner.\n\n\n\nSales & Enterprise Enablement\n\n - Create and maintain enablement tools - sales playbooks, ROI calculators, demo narratives, and enterprise decks.\n\n - Align product marketing with commercial and clinical motions to accelerate enterprise traction.\n\n - Measure enablement outcomes - asset adoption, certification completion, and field-confidence improvements.\n\nExperimentation & Measurement\n\n - Instrument funnels and message tests to measure activation, conversion, and expansion.\n\n - Translate insights into roadmap and GTM decisions.\n\n - Maintain a robust measurement system to tie PMM efforts to pipeline and revenue performance.\n\nTeam Leadership & Collaboration\n\n - Lead a high-performing team spanning product launches, competitive insights, customer marketing, and enablement.\n\n - Build rituals, processes, and culture that emphasise quality, collaboration, and measurable impact.\n\n - Champion alignment between Product, Brand, and Growth to ensure consistency from roadmap to market.\n\nWhat we will look for:\n\n - Proven experience leading product marketing in high-growth SaaS or healthcare technology companies.\n\n - Demonstrated success in category creation, repositioning, or launching enterprise-grade products.\n\n - Deep understanding of clinician and enterprise buyer dynamics, healthcare workflows, and regulated tech.\n\n - Mastery of positioning, segmentation, pricing/packaging, and tiered launches.\n\n - Strong analytical and research skills \u2014 win/loss analysis, market mapping, and message testing.\n\n - Strategic storyteller who can translate AI innovation into tangible, human-centric value.\n\n - Experienced team builder who blends strategic thinking with operational excellence.\n\n\nWHAT DO WE BELIEVE IN?\n\nHeidi builds for the future of healthcare, not just the next quarter, and our goals are ambitious because the world\u2019s health demands it. We believe in progress built through precision, pace, and ownership.\n\n - Live Forever - Every release moves care forward: measured, safe, and built to last. Data guides us, but patients define the truth that matters.\n\n - Practice Ownership - Decisions follow logic and proof, not hierarchy. Exceptional care demands exceptional standards in our work, our thinking, and our character.\n\n - Small Cuts Heal Faster - Stability earns trust, speed delivers impact. Progress is about learning fast without breaking what people depend on.\n\n - Make others better - Feedback is direct, kindness is constant, and excellence lifts everyone. Our success is measured by collective growth, not individual output.\n\nOur mission is clear: expand the world\u2019s capacity to care, and do it without losing the humanity that makes care worth delivering.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD JOIN HEIDI\n\n - Real product momentum.

Heidi is one of the first real examples of that future - already live, already trusted, and already changing lives.\n\nBuilt by clinicians, for clinicians, we\u2019re a team of doctors, engineers, designers, and operators. We\u2019ve supported over 20 million consults globally and now power more than 2 million consults every week.\n\nFollowing a recent $65m USD raise, we\u2019re scaling fast across Australia, the UK, and North America. Our free AI medical scribe is already used by thousands of clinicians - and now we\u2019re looking for someone to help turn that momentum into something bigger.\n\nThe Role\n\nWe\u2019re hiring a proactive, empathetic, and execution-focused Customer Success Associate to support the onboarding and training of our SMB customer groups in the UK.\n\nBased in our London office, you\u2019ll be at the heart of ensuring clinicians not only adopt Heidi, but truly embed it into their daily practice.\n\nHeidi is already in the hands of clinicians across the UK. They\u2019re using it every day to transform how they deliver care. The product is proven, the feedback is strong, and demand is growing. Now, the challenge is to ensure every new customer gets the right support to go from \u201csigned up\u201d to \u201cseeing impact\u201d quickly and seamlessly.\n\nYou\u2019ll work closely with the SMB Customer Success Manager and operate across a diverse and evolving customer base: GP practices, specialist clinics, outpatient providers, and digital-first healthcare groups.\n\nMany clinicians will already have encountered Heidi through peers, partnerships, or word of mouth. Your task will be to engage those teams, deliver clear onboarding pathways, and provide training that empowers them to unlock Heidi\u2019s full value.\n\nWe\u2019re entering the next stage of growth in SMB customer success - moving from one-off wins to a repeatable playbook that ensures every customer feels supported, heard, and delighted. You\u2019ll be central to building that consistency, while also helping us refine and scale the frameworks that underpin it.\n\nThis is an ideal role for someone who thrives in a fast-moving, early-stage environment, but who also wants the reassurance that the fundamentals are already in place: proven product-market fit, strong adoption signals, and a clear appetite for expansion.\n\nYou\u2019ll be the first touchpoint for customers - and the bridge that ensures they stay, grow, and become champions of Heidi.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\nThe Customer Success Associate will be a trusted partner for our SMB customers, guiding them from their very first interaction with Heidi through to successful adoption of our platform.\n\nYou\u2019ll ensure customers feel supported, empowered, and set up for long-term success. From account setup and tailored training to quarterly check-ins, you\u2019ll deliver a world-class onboarding experience while acting as the customer\u2019s voice within our team.\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR KEY RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INCLUDE:\n\nOnboarding & Training\n\n - Lead new customer onboarding, ensuring smooth account setup and configuration.\n\n - Deliver engaging training sessions and office hours that help customers quickly realise value from Heidi.\n\n - Provide clear resources, guides, and proactive support to drive customer confidence and independence.\n\nCustomer Advocacy\n\n - Serve as the first point of contact, building strong relationships with SMB customers.\n\n - Gather feedback, surface insights, and advocate for customer needs with internal teams to help influence the evolution of our product roadmap.\n\nDrive Adoption & Engagement\n\n - Monitor customer activation metrics and ensure adoption milestones are met.\n\n - Identify at-risk accounts early and partner with customers to resolve blockers.\n\n - Track and analyse customer usage data to recommend best practices and opportunities for deeper engagement.\n\nRetention & Success\n\n - Facilitate quarterly business reviews to showcase value, align on goals, and drive retention.\n\n - Develop long-term relationships that result in satisfied, loyal customers.\n\nProcess Improvement & Playbook Development\n\n - Support the creation and iteration of customer success playbooks, frameworks, and collateral.\n\n - Continuously look for opportunities to improve efficiency and enhance the customer journey.\n\nThis role could be a great fit if:\n\n - You\u2019re early in your operations/customer success career but have already shown strong ownership, work ethic, and operational instinct\n\n - You\u2019ve worked in customer success/operations, implementation or other high-volume, high-autonomy environments\n\n - You\u2019re highly organised and can confidently manage multiple accounts and competing priorities, while maintaining attention to detail and quality\n\n - You have a customer-centric mindset and are motivated to ensure customers feel supported, valued and are setup for success\n\n - You have an analytical mindset - you\u2019re comfortable diving into data to understand customer behavior, identify patterns, and spot opportunities for improved activation, adoption and retention\n\n - You\u2019re naturally curious and enjoy problem solving - you spot gaps in the process and help fix them\n\n - You have a bias for action - you\u2019re unafraid to get your hands dirty in an extremely fast paced environment to help solve different challenges and priorities\n\n - You want to build something that matters, and are hungry to learn alongside people who\u2019ve done it before\n\n - You\u2019re excited by a market that\u2019s ambiguous and evolving - where success comes from listening closely, testing constantly, and learning fast\n\nOther things to know\n\n - We\u2019re almost always in-person, based in our London office\n\n - Experience in healthcare is great, but not required\n\n - Familiarity with AI and LLMs is a plus, but not required\n\nAt Heidi, we value drive and a passion for learning. If you don't meet every requirement but are excited about the role, we encourage you to apply. We want individuals who are eager to grow with us.\n\nWhy join Heidi\n\n - Unmatched learning curve: You\u2019ll gain hands-on experience across a broad customer base \u2014 learning how to onboard diverse clinical teams, navigate the complexities of healthcare workflows, and help shape the playbooks that define how we scale customer success at Heidi.\n\n - Real product momentum: We\u2019re not trying to generate interest, we\u2019re channelling it\n\n - Equity from day one: When Heidi wins, you win\n\n - Backed to grow: \u00a3500 personal development budget + wellness days + paid birthday off\n\n - Team you\u2019ll learn from: Work directly with operators who\u2019ve scaled unicorns", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "cb516a08-6b62-4bee-b8cc-47d2b30d00a9", "title": "Expression of Interest (US)", "department": "Other", "team": "Other", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "United States", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-10-07T16:56:29.830+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressCountry": "United States"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/heidihealth.com.au/cb516a08-6b62-4bee-b8cc-47d2b30d00a9", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/heidihealth.com.au/cb516a08-6b62-4bee-b8cc-47d2b30d00a9/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h3><strong>Who are Heidi?</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Heidi is building an AI Care Partner that supports clinicians every step of the way, from documentation to delivery of care.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We exist to double healthcare\u2019s capacity while keeping care deeply human.

You\u2019ll shape how data flows, how clinicians experience Heidi inside their EMR, and how we scale across markets without losing precision or trust.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about connecting systems \u2014 it\u2019s about transforming integrations into one of Heidi\u2019s strongest competitive moats.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Define and execute the global integrations strategy and roadmap.\n\n - Build and scale Heidi\u2019s integration platform primitives \u2014 APIs, SDKs, widgets, and partner tooling for self-service integration.\n\n - Lead prioritization across enterprise depth (Epic, Cerner, Dedalus, etc.), regional breadth (EMIS, Medtech, etc.), and platform extensibility.\n\n - Partner closely with regional SEs and TPMs to bridge customer needs with scalable, global solutions.\n\n - Partner with Engineering and regional GTM to deliver fast, reliable, secure integrations that unlock adoption and revenue.\n\n - Translate insights from enterprise EMR discovery into scalable, reusable capabilities.\n\n - Measure success through integration coverage, attach rate, and developer adoption.\n\n - Coach and mentor PMs to raise product craft and execution quality.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED\n\n - 5+ years of PM experience, with 3+ in platform, API, or integration-heavy products.\n\n - Proven experience building interoperability ecosystems (FHIR, HL7, OAuth2, OIDC, SCIM).\n\n - Strong technical fluency and empathy for engineers and developers.\n\n - Experience balancing enterprise depth with global scalability.\n\n - Skilled in cross-functional alignment across Product, Engineering, GTM, and Partnerships.\n\n - Bonus: exposure to healthtech, EMR ecosystems, or regulated SaaS.\n\n\nIF WE\u2019D WORKED TOGETHER THE LAST 6 WEEKS, YOU\u2019D HAVE:\n\n - Defined a new global integrations strategy balancing scale, DIY extensibility, regional config, and platform depth.\n\n - Built and socialized a new prioritization framework aligning global and regional needs under one model.\n\n - Refined the integrations org design to scale sustainably across regions and customers.\n\n - Led customer discovery to surface insights that improve integration experience and workflow fit.\n\n - Partnered with Engineering and vendors to streamline enterprise release and testing for major EMRs.\n\n - Worked with GTM to launch a new integration pricing model aligning commercial value and customer impact.\n\n\nWHAT DO WE BELIEVE IN?\n\nHeidi builds for the future of healthcare, not just the next quarter, and our goals are ambitious because the world\u2019s health demands it. We believe in progress built through precision, pace, and ownership.\n\n - Live Forever - Every release moves care forward: measured, safe, and built to last. Data guides us, but patients define the truth that matters.\n\n - Practice Ownership - Decisions follow logic and proof, not hierarchy. Exceptional care demands exceptional standards in our work, our thinking, and our character.\n\n - Small Cuts Heal Faster - Stability earns trust, speed delivers impact. Progress is about learning fast without breaking what people depend on.\n\n - Make others better - Feedback is direct, kindness is constant, and excellence lifts everyone. Our success is measured by collective growth, not individual output.\n\nOur mission is clear: expand the world\u2019s capacity to care, and do it without losing the humanity that makes care worth delivering.\n\n\nWHY HEIDI?\n\nOur health systems hurt everybody. Systems are log-jammed, clinicians' lives degrade in quality, and patients churn through the meat-grinder.\n\nThis is neither a special nor interesting insight.\n\nBut it means we\u2019re solving a real problem. Hundreds of thousands of clinicians use Heidi. Every clinician using Heidi gets hours back in their day. That\u2019s the starting point to build the product of your dreams: immense distribution, and a world of potential.\n\nYou\u2019ll join a team that doesn\u2019t celebrate fundraise milestones or glossy PR. We live and breathe the pain of modern health systems and won\u2019t rest until we\u2019ve exacted the change we\u2019d like to see.\n\nThe bad news: it\u2019s not an easy job \u2014 you\u2019ll tear your hair out more than once. Modern tech concepts don\u2019t transpose easily into healthcare. The lows are really low.\n\nThe good news: you\u2019ll trust and admire everyone you work with, and know you\u2019re doing the defining work of your career. The highs are blindingly high.\n\nHeidi will take care of you: equity, growth, wellness perks, and the chance to progress fast if you\u2019re an A-player.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "5768004c-5961-43d9-b0ff-bff70a0f4b69", "title": "Product Manager (Multiple Levels)", "department": "Product", "team": "Product", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "San Francisco", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-08-04T09:26:53.427+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "San Francisco"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/heidihealth.com.au/5768004c-5961-43d9-b0ff-bff70a0f4b69", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/heidihealth.com.au/5768004c-5961-43d9-b0ff-bff70a0f4b69/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h2><strong>Who are Heidi?</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Heidi is building an AI Care Partner that supports clinicians every step of the way, from documentation to delivery of care.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We exist to double healthcare\u2019s capacity while keeping care deeply human.
