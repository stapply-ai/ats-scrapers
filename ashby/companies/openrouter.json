We make AI \u201cjust work\u201d so companies can focus on what they do best.\n\nWe believe LLMs will be the largest software market ever, and today we\u2019re the largest aggregator and discovery point. We serve more than a million developers and route over $100m in annualized inference spend, backed by a16z and Menlo Ventures. We are a fully-remote team of roughly 15 people.\n\nOur culture is engineering-first and velocity-obsessed; we prize clarity, autonomy, and rapid iteration.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nThis is our first dedicated Product Management hire. You will become the connective tissue between our engineering and a fast-growing, increasingly up-market customer base of companies that rely on OpenRouter for their inference. You\u2019ll own the backlog end-to-end (triaging issues, framing trade-offs, sequencing work to ship) and create lightweight processes that keep the team organized and focused, and evolve those processes flexibly as we grow. You\u2019ll collaborate directly with the founders on product strategy, roll up your sleeves to write crisp PRDs, interview users, and validate that what we build drives results.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\nExecution & Delivery: Run sprint planning / backlog grooming in Linear (or something better). Create clear specs for both in-depth AI APIs (in collaboration with engineering), and customer-facing web application work. Define success metrics and release criteria; close the loop post-launch with monitoring and retros.\n\nDiscovery & Insight: Get on calls with both developer and enterprise buyers; synthesize findings into opportunities and PRDs. Try out the competition, keep on top of the latest trends, and help us decide where we head next.\n\nPrioritization & Strategy: Maintain a living product roadmap that links initiatives to company-level goals and OKRs.
