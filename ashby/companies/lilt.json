As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone.

So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.\n\nLILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn\u2019t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap.

As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone.

So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.\n\nLILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn\u2019t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, human-in-the-loop systems, and now agentic AI.\n\nWith AI innovation accelerating and enterprise demand growing, the next phase of LILT\u2019s journey is just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nOUR TECH\n\nWhat sets our platform apart:\n\n - Brand-aware AI that learns your voice, tone, and terminology to ensure every translation is accurate and consistent\n\n - Agentic AI workflows that automate the entire translation process from content ingestion to quality review to publishing\n\n - 100+ native integrations with systems like Adobe Experience Manager, Webflow, Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive to simplify content translation\n\n - Human-in-the-loop reviews via our global network of professional linguists, for high-impact content that requires expert review\n\n\n\nLILT IN THE NEWS\n\n - Featured in The Software Report\u2019s https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/the-top-100-software-companies-of-2024/ Top 100 Software Companies!\n\n - LILT makes it onto the Inc. 5000 List https://labs.lilt.com/lilt-listed-on-the-2024-inc-5000.\n\n - LILT\u2019s continues to be an intellectual powerhouse, holding numerous patents https://patents.justia.com/inventor/john-sturdy-denero that help power the most efficient and sophisticated AI and language models in the industry.\n\n - Check out all our news on our website https://lilt.com/news.\n\nInformation collected and processed as part of your application process, including any job applications you choose to submit, is subject to LILT's Privacy Policy at https://lilt.com/legal/privacy.\n\nAt LILT, we are committed to a fair, inclusive, and transparent hiring process.

As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. While together at Google, they were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn\u2019t used for enterprise products and services inside the company.The quality just wasn\u2019t there. So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.\n\nLILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn\u2019t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, human-in-the-loop systems, and now agentic AI.\n\nWith AI innovation accelerating and enterprise demand growing, the next phase of LILT\u2019s journey is just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nOUR TECH\n\nWhat sets our platform apart:\n\n - Brand-aware AI that learns your voice, tone, and terminology to ensure every translation is accurate and consistent\n\n - Agentic AI workflows that automate the entire translation process from content ingestion to quality review to publishing\n\n - 100+ native integrations with systems like Adobe Experience Manager, Webflow, Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive to simplify content translation\n\n - Human-in-the-loop reviews via our global network of professional linguists, for high-impact content that requires expert review\n\n\n\nLILT IN THE NEWS\n\n - Featured in The Software Report\u2019s https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/the-top-100-software-companies-of-2024/ Top 100 Software Companies!\n\n - LILT makes it onto the Inc. 5000 List https://labs.lilt.com/lilt-listed-on-the-2024-inc-5000.\n\n - LILT\u2019s continues to be an intellectual powerhouse, holding numerous patents https://patents.justia.com/inventor/john-sturdy-denero that help power the most efficient and sophisticated AI and language models in the industry.\n\n - Check out all our news on our website https://lilt.com/news.\n\nInformation collected and processed as part of your application process, including any job applications you choose to submit, is subject to LILT's Privacy Policy at https://lilt.com/legal/privacy.\n\nAt LILT, we are committed to a fair, inclusive, and transparent hiring process.

So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.\n\nLILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015.
