It listens as they read aloud, offers support when they stumble, and generates magical, personalized stories using generative AI. It works\u2014and kids love it.\n\nNow, we\u2019re scaling that success into something even bigger: a complete AI teacher for all children. We\u2019re building a real-time learning platform\u2014one that combines language, speech, and memory to power personalized, interactive education for kids worldwide. We\u2019re moving fast: we ship weekly, test directly with kids and families, and push the boundaries of what AI can do in education.\n\nWith the resources of the world's top investors and the heart of a public benefit corporation, we\u2019re here to revolutionize how children learn globally.

Our CTO and CEO have each gone through their own immigration journeys and are familiar with the challenges. We have successfully secured O-1 visas, H-1B transfers, etc. for Ello employees and retain top immigration counsel.\n\n\nABOUT ELLO\n\nEllo is a public benefit corporation on a mission to maximize the potential of all children. We\u2019re currently around 45 people, headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Nairobi, Kenya; and New York.\n\nOur team has deep expertise in artificial intelligence, K-12 education, and child development across institutions such as Stanford, Berkeley, Google, Apple, and more. We were part of Y Combinator\u2019s W20 batch and are funded by world-class investors including Goodwater Capital, Homebrew, Reed Hastings, Common Sense Growth, Ravensburger, Project A Ventures, Reach Capital, Khosla Ventures, WndrCo, Visible Ventures, and K9 Ventures.\n\nWe\u2019re a small, collaborative team that takes each other\u2019s voices very seriously. Because our mission is to support all children, it is critical that our team is representative of the communities we work in; we place significant emphasis on ensuring diversity in our team and inclusion in our culture.\n\nWe feel enormously privileged to be one of the few companies that has the opportunity to take a shot at truly revolutionizing education with AI at this inflection point in technology. We don\u2019t take it for granted, so we work quite hard to turn that vision into reality with urgency. We want to create an environment in which we can all be our best selves, use our strengths to take Ello forward, and develop our own skills. We want to have fun while working hard to do impactful things that we\u2019re proud of \u2013 and we believe it\u2019s possible to do both.\n\nAt Ello, diversity is a moral imperative and a competitive advantage. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, skin color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We plan and structure our interviews to assess skills and experience directly.
