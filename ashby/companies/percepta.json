We don't build prototypes or laboratory projects - you\u2019ll design, build, and ship production-grade AI agents and workflows that drive millions in business value for customers.\n\nOur Machine Learning Engineers:\n\n - Engineer and optimize AI/ML systems: Build end-to-end ML pipelines for data ingestion, training, evaluation, and deployment. Adapt and extend LLM models with fine-tuning, distillation, retrieval systems, and tool-use to solve domain-specific problems.\n\n - Evaluate AI systems rigorously: Develop custom evaluations to ensure models succeed in real-world environments.\n\n - Bring frontier methods into practice: Track the latest techniques in areas like RAG, tool use, multi-step agent orchestration, fine-tuning methods, and evaluation frameworks - and apply them to specific customer challenges.\n\n - Collaborate across product and research: Partner with research and product teams to turn frontier techniques into production-ready features and workflows.\n\n - Advance our core product: Encode the lessons from our customer engagements in our Mosaic product, consistently contributing reusable ML components, infrastructure abstractions, and performance improvements.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE LOOKING FOR\n\n - AI-nativeness: You're excited about the potential for AI to transform businesses and want to play a hands-on role in bringing frontier technology into critical institutions.\n\n - Strong ML foundations with hands-on experience building and deploying production models / AI systems.\n\n - Being generative and collaborative: You love constantly jamming on new \u201cwhat if\u201d ideas with teammates and partners to bridge applied engineering, product, and research efforts.\n\n - Extreme ownership: You\u2019re willing to jump in and love being the one on the hook.

You can hold the balance of speed and quality and know when to push the pace vs. when to slow down.\n\n - Customer-obsession and respect: You\u2019re motivated by understanding customer pain points and iterating directly with end users to deliver wins quickly.\n\n\nBONUS IF YOU HAVE\n\n - Hands-on experience with LLM tooling (LangGraph, Mastra, Agents SDK, etc).\n\n - Built and deployed production LLM-powered systems (tool use, RAG pipelines, multi-step agents, human-in-the-loop, etc).\n\n - Strong technical foundations in Python/TypeScript, cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) and DevOps tooling.\n\n - Prior startup or founding engineer experience, balancing craft, ownership, and speed.\n\nWe\u2019re working against an incredibly ambitious mission. It won\u2019t be easy, but it will likely be the most fulfilling work of your career.
