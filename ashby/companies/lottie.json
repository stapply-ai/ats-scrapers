You'll build Found OS, our next-generation SaaS platform that's revolutionising care home management. You'll be working on the system that helps care providers manage enquiries, track occupancy, handle billing, and deliver better care to residents across the UK.\n\nThis is a hands-on role where you'll drive technical excellence while shipping fast. You'll work across our full stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, Kubernetes), and experiment extensively with AI. We're looking for someone who embodies \"outcomes over output\" - someone who cares deeply about solving real problems for care providers, not just writing code.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb WHAT DOES THIS ROLE INVOLVE?\n\n - Building high-impact features for FoundOS, with your cross functional team\n\n - Writing clean, well-tested code that ships daily - we optimise for sustainable throughput and move fast.\n\n - Collaborating with Product and Design to drive feature decisions based on care provider needs and business outcomes.\n\n - Experimenting with AI tools and integrations to enhance both care provider workflows and internal productivity.\n\n - Contributing to our platform evolution and improving developer experience.\n\n - Contributing to our engineering culture of continuous improvement.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcaa WHAT PROBLEMS WILL YOU BE SOLVING?\n\n - Revolutionising care management with AI - You'll integrate AI to automate mundane tasks, provide intelligent transcriptions and offer predictive analysis, freeing up care providers to focus on what matters most - resident care.\n\n - Building the operational backbone of care homes - you'll develop the core FoundOS platform, building robust modules for enquiry tracking, resident occupancy, and billing. This work creates the essential tools care homes depend on daily to run their business efficiently and deliver excellent care.\n\n - Connecting the fragmented care ecosystem - You'll create seamless integrations with crucial accounting software (QuickBooks, Sage) and care planning systems. Your work will also feed FoundOS data into our marketplace, providing unique insights that help families find the right care for their loved ones.\n\n - Driving strategic decisions with data - You'll build comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboards that give care home operators the insights they need to optimise their operations and improve resident outcomes.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc40 WE THINK YOU\u2019LL BE A GREAT FIT IF\u2026\n\n - You have 4+ years of hands-on software engineering experience with strong TypeScript skills and full-stack development across modern web technologies.\n\n - You're product-minded. You think about user outcomes, not just technical solutions. You can translate business requirements into elegant technical solutions.\n\n - You write code that others love to work with - clean, tested, and maintainable. You believe in continuous improvement and leave code cleaner than you found it.\n\n - You're obsessed with AI and actively experiment with LLMs, coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, \u2026), and AI-driven productivity improvements. You understand both the potential and limitations of current AI tools.\n\n - You thrive with autonomy but love collaborating. You can drive projects independently while contributing meaningfully to team discussions and code reviews.\n\n - You ship fast and iterate. You prefer \"good enough today\" over \"perfect next week\" and optimise for learning speed over prediction accuracy.\n\n - You're genuinely curious about eldercare and motivated by our mission to transform how families find and access care.\n\n - You're eager to learn and stay current with technology trends, especially in AI and web development.\n\nSound like you but not quite 100%?
