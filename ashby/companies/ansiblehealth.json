If you make flashcards for self-study when you encounter an unfamiliar medical term or drug name; if you ask a lot of questions (particularly, \u201cwhy\u201d); if you enjoy brainstorming about patient care with your colleagues; if you have a secret mental list of ideas for care improvement, and are looking for the opportunity to try them out; if you sometimes brush your teeth for too long because you are lost in thought about a patient case; we would love to interview you.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We believe in the raw potential of an individual to become the best clinician possible when immersed in a supportive environment with high-quality mentorship.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What is the Role?</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will be part of a team led by a nurse practitioner with a mix of respiratory therapists and registered nurses to provide direct care via telemedicine to patients suffering from advanced chronic lung and heart disease. We treat an elderly patient population that is medically complex, very ill at baseline, frequently hospitalized, and often burdened by psychosocial challenges. You will collaborate closely with your medical team members, often speaking multiple times per day with the supervising nurse practitioners, physicians, and medical directors.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Examples of patient care tasks include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Performing telemedicine visits with our patients to provide education specific to their conditions</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Leading exercise sessions with your team for your patients over telehealth.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Assessing/triaging adult outpatients with multiple chronic medical conditions, with an emphasis on lung disease/heart failure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Coordinating care with primary care providers, specialists, and external care agencies</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Advocating for patients who are experiencing major social stressors by activating community resources to improve access to medications, transportation, healthy nutrition, and safe housing</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Working with your NP led team to serve as the continuous point of contact for patients and families across the entire care spectrum, ranging from transitional post-acute care, to medical stabilization, to rehabilitation, to advanced care planning and dying with dignity</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Engaging with our interdisciplinary team of physicians, engineers, designers, and other care team members to continuously optimize the care we deliver to our patients</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Intimately related to patient care, you will also play a role in promoting our program and answering questions from referring providers and practices as we become more established in your local community.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This versatile role requires you to wear many different hats throughout the week, blending aspects of medical care, education, case management/social work, marketing, and advocacy. We believe in nurturing these transferable skills within one individual, rather than creating silos of expertise across rigid professional categories. This is an unorthodox approach that challenges the current trend in healthcare, which has moved towards more and more specialization, leading to further care fragmentation. We believe that the future of healthcare rests in the hands of a new kind of cross-functional clinician.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here a few examples of our recent success stories:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A socially isolated 50-year-old woman with COPD and several overlapping anxiety disorders was frequently seen in the ED with dyspnea related to panic attacks and psychological distress. Multiple psychotropic medications were added over time, leading her to feel like a \u201czombie\u201d and drink 10 caffeinated soft drinks per day to compensate, which fueled a vicious cycle of anxiety. The patient\u2019s Ansible clinician connected her to a psychotherapist, convinced her to adopt a dog, and collaborated with her providers to discontinue and taper off several medications. The patient is now doing well at home, no longer going to the ED, and on a much safer medication regimen.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A 67-year-old man with very severe COPD and pulmonary cachexia (BMI 17.3 kg/m2) was declined for lung transplantation due to being severely underweight and unable to access a pulmonary rehabilitation facility. The patient lived in a rural Appalachian town with no cellular or internet service. The patient\u2019s Ansible clinician found a public library 3 miles from the patient that housed a WiFI-enabled conference room for telemedicine. The clinician coordinated transportation with his church, provided guidance on nutritional supplementation, and supervised the patient through pulmonary telerehabilitation. The patient\u2019s functional status improved, his BMI increased to 21.5 kg/m2, and he was listed for transplantation.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A 59-year-old woman with very severe COPD, HFpEF, and ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted to the hospital 13 times within the last year for various acute issues including COPD exacerbations, pulmonary edema, and unstable atrial fibrillation. Our clinical team pursued multiple avenues of medical optimization and rehabilitation but the patient continued to deteriorate. Throughout the patient\u2019s journey in the medical system, her Ansible clinician was the most stable contact point, and was able to use the therapeutic rapport to initiate a discussion about end-of-life care.
