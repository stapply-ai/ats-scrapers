We are training foundation models from scratch, designing new reasoning architectures, and deploying them on state-of-the-art GPU clusters. This is not fine-tuning someone else\u2019s work.

You\u2019ll work on both sides of the problem: how models are trained and how they run in the world. You\u2019ll design and build the systems that power large-scale training runs and efficient inference. You\u2019ll work closely with our AI Researchers to implement the latest algorithms and ideas.\n\nThis is a deep engineering role. You\u2019ll be writing a lot of code, instrumenting systems, optimizing performance, and debugging weird, messy edge cases in distributed training and model serving. If you love figuring out how foundation models really work under the hood, this is your team.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Build and scale training pipelines for sovereign foundation models like large language models and other architectures\n\n - Design efficient inference systems that run these models in real-world environments\n\n - Optimize data pipelines, tokenization, batch prep, and distributed training at multi-node scale\n\n - Build deep observability into training and inference, improving performance, correctness, and efficiency\n\n - Debug and troubleshoot the hardest parts of model training and deployment, including distributed failures, GPU bugs, data inconsistencies, and scaling limits\n\n - Work closely with AI Researchers to translate cutting-edge algorithms into working systems\n\n - Establish strong ModelOps practices to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and continuous improvement across the full lifecycle of foundation models, from initial experiments to production deployment\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - Passionate about how models are built, trained, and run, especially large-scale foundation models\n\n - Driven by curiosity about model internals, training dynamics, and system-level performance\n\n - Excited to work across both training and inference, not just one side of the ML stack\n\n - Skilled in Python and ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX.
