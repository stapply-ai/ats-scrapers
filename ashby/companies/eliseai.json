Everyone needs a place to live and access to quality healthcare, yet both are often harder to secure than they should be.\n\nBy integrating AI agents deeply into existing workflows, we make them more efficient, reduce costs, and improve the experience for everyone.\n\n - Healthcare: We make it easy to schedule appointments, complete intake forms, and we help patients communicate with providers, so everyone can focus on health instead of paperwork.\n   \n\n - Housing: We simplify how renters tour apartments, sign leases, submit maintenance requests, and stay connected with their property team\u2014bringing everything they need for their home into one place.\n\nWith EliseAI, organizations reduce manual work, improve accessibility, and deliver a seamless experience across essential services. We recently raised a $250 million Series E round https://www.eliseai.com/blog/eliseai-raises-250m-series-e led by Andreessen Horowitz to accelerate this mission.\n\nAbout the role\n\nAre you energized by the rapid evolution of AI and excited to put cutting-edge tools into action? Do you thrive at the intersection of technology, operations, and customer experience?\n\nAs a CX Solutions Specialist, you\u2019ll be at the forefront of testing, implementing, and scaling AI-powered solutions that directly improve how we support our clients. You\u2019ll architect automation workflows, optimize our support platforms, and help shape how we operationalize feedback across the customer journey.\n\nYou\u2019ll play a key role in building and maintaining the technical infrastructure that powers our support operations and Voice of the Customer program. From first response to final resolution, your work will have a direct impact on core CX metrics\u2014including first response time, full resolution time, CSAT, and NPS\u2014and will enable our teams to focus on what matters most: delivering a world-class experience to our clients.\n\nAbout the CX Solutions Team\n\nOur team is hyper-focused on four core themes that drive a more seamless and scalable client experience:\n\n1. Voice of the Customer: We\u2019re building a robust Voice of the Customer program by capturing feedback through formal channels (like NPS and surveys), informal sources (such as Zendesk tickets and client calls), and implicit user behavior. These insights guide how we identify friction points and design an experience that minimizes confusion and helps our clients succeed.\n\n2. Self-Service & Ticket Deflection: When clients do encounter challenges, we aim to provide fast, effective support through self-service tools and AI-enabled solutions that reduce reliance on human support and enable quicker resolutions.\n\n3. Empowered Support: For moments that require a human touch, we focus on equipping our support teams with the tools, workflows, and context they need to deliver efficient, high-quality service at scale.\n\n4. Customer Feedback Loop: We continuously analyze service interactions, behavioral data, and client feedback to ensure insights are fed back into product development, CX strategy, and content improvements.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nAutomation & Platform Development\n\n - Design and implement automations and workflows in Zendesk and Assembled to deflect tickets, improve ticket handling, and analyze feedback/themes across platforms\n\n - Partner with cross functional teams to implement AI-enabled solutions such as automatically QA human and AI interactions, generating content, and identifying VoC themes\n\n - Maintain and expand custom integrations across support tools (e.g., using APIs, webhooks, and scripts)\n\nSystem Administration & Optimization\n\n - Own end-to-end strategic system configuration in Zendesk: triggers and automations, side conversations, support applications, etc\n\n - Troubleshoot technical issues and collaborate with vendors (Zendesk, Assembled) to resolve and optimize platform performance\n\n - Maintain comprehensive documentation and runbooks for technical processes and system architecture\n\nPerformance Monitoring & Insights\n\n - Analyze support data to identify inefficiencies, automation opportunities, and root causes of delays in resolution or response\n\n - Build reporting views and dashboards to track the effectiveness of new workflows and automations\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally with Support, CS-Ops, Documentation, and Product teams to align on process design and improvement areas\n\nMove at rocket speed, build something massive.\n\nWe\u2019re scaling fast, solving real client problems with precision and ambition. Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff. We hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s intense, and it\u2019s the most rewarding work you\u2019ll ever do. If you\u2019re hungry, driven, and ready to build something massive, climb aboard.\n\nRequirements\n\n - 3-5 years of experience in support operations, technical operations, or platform administration\u2014ideally in a SaaS environment\n\n - Advanced proficiency with Zendesk (or similar ticketing platform), including API usage, automation design, and configuration best practices\n\n - Experience implementing or integrating AI-powered workflows or bots is a strong plus\n\n - Strong technical aptitude and ability to translate operational needs into scalable system designs\n\n - Familiarity with scripting (e.g., Python, JavaScript) or data tools (e.g., SQL, Looker, Explore) is a plus\n\n - Highly detail-oriented with excellent documentation, troubleshooting, and communication skills\n\n - Comfortable working in person at our NYC office 4\u20135 days per week\n\nWhy Join\n\nGrowth and impact.

Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff. We hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s intense, and it\u2019s the most rewarding work you\u2019ll ever do. If you\u2019re hungry, driven, and ready to build something massive, climb aboard.\n\nRequirements\n\nWe recognize that GTM Engineering is a brand new role in the industry and that candidates may not have all of the qualifications listed below. As such, we\u2019re looking for curious builders who are excited by the role, not just those who check every box.\n\n - 2+ years in a technical or operations role, with experience improving or automating workflows using code (vibe-coding is fine!) and low-code/no-code tools (e.g. Zapier, Clay, Gong, Attention).\n\n - Practical experience pushing and pulling data across systems via APIs and webhooks\n\n - Proven ability to take projects from 0\u21921: from experimentation and prototyping through rollout and adoption.\n\n - Curious, scrappy builder with a love for experimentation who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys automating manual work, and owns projects end-to-end.\n\n - Experience with and strong interest in AI systems.\n\n - Excellent cross-functional collaboration and communication skills; able to partner effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders at all levels (individual contributors up to C-suite).\n\n - Strong analytical mindset, with the ability to track ROI, adoption, and system performance.\n\n - Hands-on experience with, or deep empathy for, GTM processes (sales, marketing, customer success, revenue operations, recruiting).\n\n - Bonus:\n   \n   - Proficiency in Python, JavaScript, or SQL.\n   \n   - Admin-level experience with GTM tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Gong, Attention, or Outreach.\n\n - Willingness to work in person at our office 4-5 days a week\n   \n\nWhy Join\n\nGrowth and impact.

That means that instead of following a playbook, you\u2019ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it.
