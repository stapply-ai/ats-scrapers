At Ashby, you'll be part designer, part product manager, part consultant, and part design system manager (or some combination of the 4!). We do design differently here, and if that excites you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our unique approach is working - we're growing &gt;100% year-over-year and have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, very low churn, and many years of runway. We're backed by amazing investors like Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, and many more! We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In my previous roles, product teams always consisted of a product manager, a designer, and ~4-5 engineers. This may sound familiar to you! The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers. <br /><br />We take a more principled approach here at Ashby. If you've been designing software enough, you'll realize in actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes in the past, I'd be asked to design yet another settings page, when really all that was needed was an engineer to reuse existing components and just follow some documentation I had written. Other times, I felt I should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it made sense that I was even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.<br /><br />This principled approach is now what we do here, and it is part of what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals all at once. We don't settle for the status quo\u2014we actively resist reversion to the mean.<br /><br />Currently, I report to Benji, the co-founder &amp; CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full-time designers who happen to have the job title. <br /><br />The design <em><strong>department\u2019s</strong></em> job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Separate from design, you may also be excited by the fact that we maintain a near seed-stage-like culture with fuzzy lines between functional roles, as much autonomy as you can handle, and a focus on IC-work with an almost-no-meeting culture. While you get the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup, you also get the agency and no-nonsense, no-red-tape culture of a seed-stage startup.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn\u2019t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Your qualifications:</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">4+ years of product design experience in desktop SaaS.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to think from first principles instead of simply applying the \u201cstandard\u201d UX processes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Can break down complex user problems by asking questions that narrow down the solution space.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Enough experience that your intuition can solve many usability problems without having to rely solely on data &amp; metrics or conducting user research.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Curious &amp; resourceful enough to come up with creative solutions and de-risk them appropriately.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong skills in layout, navigation, IA, UI, and interaction design.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong visual design skills and obsession with craft &amp; details.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a bonus, you have experience<em> </em>at an early-stage startup or have spent time as a solo designer on a team.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>You may want to apply if you\u2019re excited about:</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Creating leverage and impact far and above what you'd see in a typical EPD product team structure.

At Ashby, you'll be part designer, part product manager, part consultant, and part design system manager (or some combination of the 4!). We do design differently here, and if that excites you, read on.\n\nOur unique approach is working - we're growing >100% year-over-year and have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, very low churn, and many years of runway. We're backed by amazing investors like Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, and many more! We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nHOW WE WORK\n\nIn my previous roles, product teams always consisted of a product manager, a designer, and ~4-5 engineers. This may sound familiar to you! The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers.\n\nWe take a more principled approach here at Ashby. If you've been designing software enough, you'll realize in actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes in the past, I'd be asked to design yet another settings page, when really all that was needed was an engineer to reuse existing components and just follow some documentation I had written. Other times, I felt I should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it made sense that I was even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.\n\nThis principled approach is now what we do here, and it is part of what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals all at once. We don't settle for the status quo\u2014we actively resist reversion to the mean.\n\nCurrently, I report to Benji, the co-founder & CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full-time designers who happen to have the job title.\n\nThe design department\u2019s job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves.\n\nSeparate from design, you may also be excited by the fact that we maintain a near seed-stage-like culture with fuzzy lines between functional roles, as much autonomy as you can handle, and a focus on IC-work with an almost-no-meeting culture. While you get the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup, you also get the agency and no-nonsense, no-red-tape culture of a seed-stage startup.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others.\n\nAshby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\n\nYOUR QUALIFICATIONS:\n\n - 4+ years of product design experience in desktop SaaS.\n\n - Able to think from first principles instead of simply applying the \u201cstandard\u201d UX processes.\n\n - Can break down complex user problems by asking questions that narrow down the solution space.\n\n - Enough experience that your intuition can solve many usability problems without having to rely solely on data & metrics or conducting user research.\n\n - Curious & resourceful enough to come up with creative solutions and de-risk them appropriately.\n\n - Strong skills in layout, navigation, IA, UI, and interaction design.\n\n - Strong visual design skills and obsession with craft & details.\n\n - As a bonus, you have experience at an early-stage startup or have spent time as a solo designer on a team.\n\n\nYOU MAY WANT TO APPLY IF YOU\u2019RE EXCITED ABOUT:\n\n - Creating leverage and impact far and above what you'd see in a typical EPD product team structure.

We\u2019re looking for an Engineering leader who has done it all: You\u2019ve built impressive products as an IC, you\u2019ve built a bench of amazing Engineers, and you\u2019ve established the cultural norms and processes of an entire Engineering department. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional and then figure out how to hire them and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As Head of Engineering in the Americas, you\u2019ll work closely with me and your counterpart in EMEA, Colin, to continue scaling our unique culture. You\u2019ll manage our remote team of 20 engineers and 2 EMs, who cover a wide variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Over the next year, you\u2019ll grow that team to 40 engineers and 5-6 EMs.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We\u2019re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve always been a line manager or middle manager.</em> You haven\u2019t led the definition and evolution of the culture and processes of an entire Engineering department.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve never managed managers.</em> Managing other leaders is a very different ball game, and not everyone enjoys it or thrives in it \u2013 the seniority of this role won\u2019t let you explore that.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll be a <em>critical</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day.

We\u2019re looking for an Engineering leader who has done it all: You\u2019ve built impressive products as an IC, you\u2019ve built a bench of amazing Engineers, and you\u2019ve established the cultural norms and processes of an entire Engineering department. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional and then figure out how to hire them and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional.\n\nIn other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.\n\nAs Head of Engineering in the Americas, you\u2019ll work closely with me and your counterpart in EMEA, Colin, to continue scaling our unique culture. You\u2019ll manage our remote team of 20 engineers and 2 EMs, who cover a wide variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Over the next year, you\u2019ll grow that team to 40 engineers and 5-6 EMs.\n\nI\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\n - You\u2019ve always been a line manager or middle manager. You haven\u2019t led the definition and evolution of the culture and processes of an entire Engineering department.\n\n - You\u2019ve never managed managers. Managing other leaders is a very different ball game, and not everyone enjoys it or thrives in it \u2013 the seniority of this role won\u2019t let you explore that.\n\n - You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou\u2019ll be a critical part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019ve already gathered an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Why be a manager?</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a <em>terrible</em> manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.\n\nWe\u2019ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a terrible manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n\nSince then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n\nDespite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I also built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n\nIt can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nEngineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I\u2019d outline some things I\u2019m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n\n - You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n\n - You hold your team to a high standard and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n\n - You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\u00a0\n\n - You know what exceptional engineers look like. You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\n - You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n\n - You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments.

We\u2019re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and <em>not</em> breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an Engineering Manager, you\u2019ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You\u2019ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They\u2019ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We\u2019re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You follow the rules and accept the hand you\u2019ve been dealt.</em> We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it\u2019s within their own team or across departments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll be an <em>important</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with me (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on my bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we\u2019ll do reference checks.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is also an important decision for you, so I\u2019m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don\u2019t move forward, we\u2019re happy to share feedback.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Six Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you\u2019ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you\u2019ll be able to push your first product change on day one.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we\u2019ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I\u2019m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don\u2019t move forward, we\u2019re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you\u2019ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you\u2019ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We\u2019re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and <em>not</em> breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an Engineering Manager, you\u2019ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You\u2019ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They\u2019ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We\u2019re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You follow the rules and accept the hand you\u2019ve been dealt.</em> We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it\u2019s within their own team or across departments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll be an <em>important</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company.

We\u2019re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.\n\nAs an Engineering Manager, you\u2019ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.\n\nYou\u2019ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You\u2019ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They\u2019ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:\n\n - Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\nYou\u2019ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:\n\n - Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.\n\n - Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\nI\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\n - You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You follow the rules and accept the hand you\u2019ve been dealt. We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it\u2019s within their own team or across departments.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou\u2019ll be an important part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we\u2019ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I\u2019m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don\u2019t move forward, we\u2019re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you\u2019ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you\u2019ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake.

We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "CA$172.5K \u2013 CA$335K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Multiple Ranges", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "CA$172.5K - CA$335K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "d15a5dde-f80e-4c04-8787-367278e02e2b", "tierSummary": "CA$172.5K \u2013 CA$205K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "CAN - Level 4", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "486ee96f-756e-4324-8a91-500bc11b26e9", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "9f2cd679-e807-4059-a159-1c0989dc9688", "summary": "CA$172.5K \u2013 CA$205K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "CAD", "minValue": 172500, "maxValue": 205000}]}, {"id": "f8141787-493a-4076-86e8-cbf2677b6df8", "tierSummary": "CA$182.5K \u2013 CA$235K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "CAN - Level 5", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "f0839de0-e78b-42d1-8677-c0f95db7010c", "summary": "CA$182.5K \u2013 CA$235K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "CAD", "minValue": 182500, "maxValue": 235000}, {"id": "eb6ad53a-a6fb-4b4d-bd6e-0235892f494e", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}, {"id": "d0a28896-4d90-416b-ac4c-c3a4bfdbbf96", "tierSummary": "CA$235K \u2013 CA$335K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "CAN - Level 6", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "3c2726eb-0301-4a5e-b4ba-47d63a96c4d0", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "2f6b8622-44ad-4584-930b-8283fdc91135", "summary": "CA$235K \u2013 CA$335K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "CAD", "minValue": 235000, "maxValue": 335000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null, "interval": "1 YEAR"}, {"minValue": 172500, "maxValue": 335000, "currencyCode": "CAD", "interval": "1 YEAR", "compensationType": "Salary"}]}}, {"id": "7850dae6-9582-49ea-a385-0621dbe33769", "title": "Senior Software Engineer - Product Engineering, Berlin (m/f/d)", "department": "Engineering", "team": "EMEA Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Remote - Europe", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [{"location": "Berlin", "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Berlin", "addressCountry": "Germany", "addressLocality": "Berlin"}}}], "publishedAt": "2025-10-13T16:21:11.007+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Berlin", "addressCountry": "Germany", "addressLocality": "Berlin"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/7850dae6-9582-49ea-a385-0621dbe33769", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/7850dae6-9582-49ea-a385-0621dbe33769/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe I\u2019m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a fully remote role, with Berlin as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Germany or nearby time zones.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\nThis is a fully remote role, with Berlin as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Germany or nearby time zones.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes.

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one \u2014I couldn\u2019t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you\u2019ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate\u2019s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we\u2019re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company.

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one \u2014I couldn\u2019t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you\u2019ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate\u2019s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we\u2019re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes.

We\u2019re looking for an Engineering leader who has done it all: You\u2019ve built impressive products as an IC, you\u2019ve built a bench of amazing Engineers, and you\u2019ve established the cultural norms and processes of an entire Engineering department. Ashby\u2019s success and ambition mean we\u2019re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional and then figure out how to hire them and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you\u2019ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As Head of Engineering in the Americas, you\u2019ll work closely with me and your counterpart in EMEA, Colin, to continue scaling our unique culture. You\u2019ll manage our remote team of 20 engineers and 2 EMs, who cover a wide variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Over the next year, you\u2019ll grow that team to 40 engineers and 5-6 EMs.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We\u2019re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve always been a line manager or middle manager.</em> You haven\u2019t led the definition and evolution of the culture and processes of an entire Engineering department.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve never managed managers.</em> Managing other leaders is a very different ball game, and not everyone enjoys it or thrives in it \u2013 the seniority of this role won\u2019t let you explore that.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don\u2019t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll be a <em>critical</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is an important role that will lead half of our Engineering team now and for the foreseeable future. The interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (~6.5h):</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with me (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A deep dive into a past project with other Engineering Leaders (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Benji, our CEO (45m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final round where you meet various folks on the team (90m)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on my bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we\u2019ll do reference checks.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is also an important decision for you, so I\u2019m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Six Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you\u2019ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you\u2019ll be able to push your first product change on day one.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou\u2019ll be a critical part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role that will lead half of our Engineering team now and for the foreseeable future. The interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (~6.5h):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. A deep dive into a past project with other Engineering Leaders (1h, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m)\n\n 6. Interview with Benji, our CEO (45m, live)\n\n 7. Final round where you meet various folks on the team (90m)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we\u2019ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I\u2019m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you\u2019ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you\u2019ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019ve already gathered an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Why be a manager?</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a <em>terrible</em> manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I <em>also</em> built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Engineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I\u2019d outline some things I\u2019m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You love being technical</em> and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You enjoy management problems</em>. We want people who get <em>excited </em>about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You hold your team to a high standard</em> and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are an excellent and empathetic communicator.</em> Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback. </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know what exceptional engineers look like.</em> You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business</em>, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments</em>. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I\u2019ll share more once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Collaboration is Natural, Communication is Deliberate</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day.

All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don\u2019t get to practice as engineers, and, as a manager at Ashby, you\u2019ll provide mentorship and feedback to engineers to ensure they are successful when delivering projects.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Put Effort into Diversity </h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\"> <u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.\n\nWe\u2019ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a terrible manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n\nSince then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n\nDespite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I also built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n\nIt can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nEngineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I\u2019d outline some things I\u2019m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n\n - You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n\n - You hold your team to a high standard and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n\n - You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\n\n - You know what exceptional engineers look like. You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\n - You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n\n - You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.\n\n - You\u2019ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available\n\n - You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.\n\n - You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75\n\nAshby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I\u2019ll share more once we meet.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL, COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it here https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\n\n\n\nGIVE ENGINEERS OWNERSHIP & AUTONOMY\n\nWe, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don\u2019t get to practice as engineers, and, as a manager at Ashby, you\u2019ll provide mentorship and feedback to engineers to ensure they are successful when delivering projects.\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter. As the father of two young girls, I want to see them grow up in a world where all industries are open and welcoming to everyone, regardless of race, gender, or preferences. Helping to build a more diverse team at Ashby is my way of contributing to this change.\n\nToday, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together. Our interview process is six interviews in the following order:\n\n 1. Intro Call (30m) - Discuss your application questions, align on the responsibilities of the role, and answer questions about Ashby.\n\n 2.

We\u2019re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who\u2019s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We\u2019ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day.

We\u2019re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who\u2019s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We\u2019ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn.

You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model.

Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/).

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things\u00a0 to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things\u00a0 to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\u00a0\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn\u2019t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level.

So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch.

The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help.

Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\u00a0\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount.

They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one \u2014I couldn\u2019t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you\u2019ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate\u2019s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we\u2019re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire.

Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one \u2014I couldn\u2019t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you\u2019ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate\u2019s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we\u2019re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve.

At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you\u2019ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate\u2019s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we\u2019re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn\u2019t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made.

So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch.

The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help.

Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Since then, I\u2019ve worked across RevOps and Customer Marketing at Procore and Meta, partnering with incredible teams to bring differentiated products to market. I first heard of Ashby through our Head of Content, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anumhussain/\"><u>Anum</u></a> with whom I\u2019d spent those early days at HubSpot, and was inspired by the level of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/thoughtful-communication\"><u>thoughtfulness</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/ashbys-operating-principles\"><u>operating principles</u></a> I saw and read about. I joined Ashby in April of 2024 - bringing all these experiences together to help build a thoughtful, high-impact Product Marketing team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re a small, tight-knit team - and we\u2019re just getting started \ud83d\ude80 We work closely with Product, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, and every level of leadership, including closely with our CEO <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>. We\u2019re seen as strategic partners, not a service desk. PMM at Ashby means influence, visibility, and ownership - and this role is a chance to get in early on a team with strong internal momentum at a company growing fast.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We value technical curiosity, editorial clarity, and first-principles thinking. We avoid jargon, favor plain English, and aim to genuinely help customers understand what our product does and how it can help them. You don\u2019t need a decade in PMM to succeed here - but you <em>do</em> need strong product instincts, clear writing, and a bias for building systems that scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h3><strong>About this Role</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re looking for a <strong>Senior Product Marketing Manager </strong>to focus specifically on <strong>new products.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>You\u2019ll help bring brand-new products to life, setting the foundation for how we define, position, and grow them from day one.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re a small, high-impact team helping build a best-in-class go-to-market engine. You\u2019ll be joining during a pivotal phase as Ashby expands into a multi-product platform.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is <strong>not</strong> a feature launch or SKU expansion role.

Since then, I\u2019ve worked across RevOps and Customer Marketing at Procore and Meta, partnering with incredible teams to bring differentiated products to market. I first heard of Ashby through our Head of Content, Anum https://www.linkedin.com/in/anumhussain/ with whom I\u2019d spent those early days at HubSpot, and was inspired by the level of thoughtfulness https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/thoughtful-communication and operating principles https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/ashbys-operating-principles I saw and read about. I joined Ashby in April of 2024 - bringing all these experiences together to help build a thoughtful, high-impact Product Marketing team.\n\nWe\u2019re a small, tight-knit team - and we\u2019re just getting started \ud83d\ude80 We work closely with Product, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, and every level of leadership, including closely with our CEO Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/. We\u2019re seen as strategic partners, not a service desk. PMM at Ashby means influence, visibility, and ownership - and this role is a chance to get in early on a team with strong internal momentum at a company growing fast.\n\nWe value technical curiosity, editorial clarity, and first-principles thinking. We avoid jargon, favor plain English, and aim to genuinely help customers understand what our product does and how it can help them. You don\u2019t need a decade in PMM to succeed here - but you do need strong product instincts, clear writing, and a bias for building systems that scale.\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a Senior Product Marketing Manager to focus specifically on new products.\n\nYou\u2019ll help bring brand-new products to life, setting the foundation for how we define, position, and grow them from day one.\n\nWe\u2019re a small, high-impact team helping build a best-in-class go-to-market engine. You\u2019ll be joining during a pivotal phase as Ashby expands into a multi-product platform.\n\nThis is not a feature launch or SKU expansion role.

You don\u2019t rely on \u2018I\u2019ve seen this done\u2019 but instead think critically to solve problems.\n\n - Cross-functional Collaboration: You effectively partner with cross-functional stakeholders across Customer Success, Sales, Product, Engineering, and Operations to align and define progress.\n\nYou could be a great fit if:\n\n - \ud83d\udce3 You demonstrate clear communication.

I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\nThis is a fully remote role, with Copenhagen as the official location.

When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount.

While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a fully remote role, with Stuttgart as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Germany or nearby time zones.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example.

You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn.

You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\nThis is a fully remote role, with Stuttgart as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Germany or nearby time zones.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model.

We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.

We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "\u20ac76K \u2013 \u20ac150K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Multiple Ranges", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "\u20ac76K - \u20ac150K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "d308731a-6fdc-4e6a-ad2a-ceb809cda9a2", "tierSummary": "\u20ac76K \u2013 \u20ac117K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "EU - Level 3", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d9d27f32-596f-4992-b3e3-377ea2a22524", "summary": "\u20ac76K \u2013 \u20ac117K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "EUR", "minValue": 76000, "maxValue": 117000}, {"id": "a8c07eeb-3584-45fa-b27e-645b5acd00fb", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}, {"id": "65270e3d-e573-4c58-9ca1-ee2664eb420a", "tierSummary": "\u20ac95K \u2013 \u20ac130K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "EU - Level 4", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d2f263b5-5def-447f-ae2b-730b2e921d3b", "summary": "\u20ac95K \u2013 \u20ac130K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "EUR", "minValue": 95000, "maxValue": 130000}, {"id": "d00df1d7-c74b-44fe-a367-948424040e81", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}, {"id": "1391d278-b7bf-4b25-8754-d7289ab759ca", "tierSummary": "\u20ac117K \u2013 \u20ac150K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "EU - Level 5", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "66836190-06e6-4035-ab0b-782ee3237bfa", "summary": "\u20ac117K \u2013 \u20ac150K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "EUR", "minValue": 117000, "maxValue": 150000}, {"id": "d557f668-cbc5-43f5-9b74-521e5a764a9d", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"minValue": 76000, "maxValue": 150000, "currencyCode": "EUR", "interval": "1 YEAR", "compensationType": "Salary"}, {"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null, "interval": "1 YEAR"}]}}, {"id": "1066eb62-aeca-4880-8d69-f15e9c831ef2", "title": "Senior Software Engineer - Product Engineering, Stockholm", "department": "Engineering", "team": "EMEA Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Remote - Europe", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [{"location": "Stockholm", "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressCountry": "Sweden", "addressLocality": "Stockholm"}}}], "publishedAt": "2025-10-14T17:16:41.631+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Berlin", "addressCountry": "Germany", "addressLocality": "Berlin"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/1066eb62-aeca-4880-8d69-f15e9c831ef2", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/1066eb62-aeca-4880-8d69-f15e9c831ef2/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe I\u2019m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is a fully remote role, with Stockholm as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Sweden or nearby time zones.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\nThis is a fully remote role, with Stockholm as the official location. We welcome applicants based in Sweden or nearby time zones.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices.

The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/).

I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn\u2019t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Benefits</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch.

These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones.

You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Benefits</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you\u2019re an engineer who wants to build a \u201cpaved road\u201d that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe\u2019ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I\u2019ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they\u2019ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I\u2019ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We\u2019re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you\u2019ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don\u2019t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don\u2019t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe\u2019re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact \u2013 we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don\u2019t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That\u2019s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today\u2019s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn\u2019t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You\u2019ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we\u2019ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don\u2019t take shortcuts. You\u2019re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You\u2019re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You\u2019ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you\u2019ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You\u2019ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You\u2019re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You\u2019ll get every hard problem the company faces. You\u2019ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they\u2019re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don\u2019t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We\u2019re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You\u2019ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with.

Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "\u00a3130K \u2013 \u00a3190K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Multiple Ranges", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "\u00a3130K - \u00a3190K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "463566c0-bdb2-40bc-b70f-977bf9e648e5", "tierSummary": "\u00a3130K \u2013 \u00a3190K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "GBR", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "eb8b97a4-7749-477f-8723-887add07d189", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "394ecf2d-b872-4f14-aaad-6dc4281e1105", "summary": "\u00a3130K \u2013 \u00a3190K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "GBP", "minValue": 130000, "maxValue": 190000}]}, {"id": "9d7d7e50-939a-4477-bc8b-a1e19edefa2f", "tierSummary": "\u20ac100K \u2013 \u20ac175K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": "EU", "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d23b7a6a-fa38-401d-86b8-f6c54d33e852", "summary": "\u20ac100K \u2013 \u20ac175K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "EUR", "minValue": 100000, "maxValue": 175000}, {"id": "bbd0c9ca-769d-45fe-a283-5f33f7b6132f", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null, "interval": "1 YEAR"}, {"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "GBP", "minValue": 130000, "maxValue": 190000}]}}, {"id": "88b63239-c9ca-4e21-92f3-09b1dcfce175", "title": "Senior Software Engineer - Product Engineering", "department": "Engineering", "team": "EMEA Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "UK", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-06-06T18:36:29.484+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "London", "addressCountry": "United Kingdom", "addressLocality": "London"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/88b63239-c9ca-4e21-92f3-09b1dcfce175", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ashby/88b63239-c9ca-4e21-92f3-09b1dcfce175/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe I\u2019m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes.

We\u2019re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019ve already gathered an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Why be a manager?</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a <em>terrible</em> manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I <em>also</em> built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Engineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model.

Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom.

These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.\n\nWe\u2019ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you\u2019ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a terrible manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n\nSince then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n\nDespite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I also built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n\nIt can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nEngineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I\u2019d outline some things I\u2019m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n\n - You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n\n - You hold your team to a high standard and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n\n - You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\n\n - You know what exceptional engineers look like. You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\n - You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n\n - You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.\n\n - You\u2019ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available\n\n - You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.

We\u2019re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who\u2019s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We\u2019ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We\u2019re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you\u2019re looking for:\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what\u2019s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We\u2019ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You\u2019ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We\u2019re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn\u2019t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn\u2019t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency\u2014we\u2019ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you\u2019ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you\u2019ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You\u2019re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don\u2019t mean you work in a vacuum. You\u2019ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it\u2019s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You\u2019d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We\u2019re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven\u2019t led or taken ownership of projects before. You\u2019re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji\u2019s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we\u2019ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren\u2019t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer\u2019s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer\u2019s time and freedom\u2014both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn\u2019t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the \u201cbest.\u201d\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It\u2019s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we\u2019d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We\u2019re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who\u2019s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We\u2019ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We\u2019ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen this role posted before, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re always expanding the team (we\u2019re on track to double this year). We\u2019re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we\u2019ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs \u2013 where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer\u2019s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\u00a0\n\nAt Ashby, we\u2019re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you\u2019ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You\u2019ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75 TA software didn\u2019t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that\u2019s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN\u2019T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model.

Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We\u2019ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We\u2019ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team\u2019s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you\u2019ll need minimal preparation). You\u2019ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt\u2019s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you\u2019ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful \ud83d\ude00): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you\u2019re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.
