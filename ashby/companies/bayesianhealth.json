Your attention to detail drives you to ensure that a product comes to life - shaping thorough scoping, identifying risks and edge cases, driving testing, considering client success and user education, and seeing it all the way to a clinical user\u2019s screen. With a rich understanding of healthcare, you understand that delivering a product does not ensure adoption or scalability, which is why workflows are critical to our technical success. You can move seamlessly between stakeholders and are just as comfortable reining technical requirements in JIRA or debugging an HL7 or FHIR mapping issue as you are explaining the tradeoffs of a flowsheet writeback to a nurse leader.\n\nResponsibilities\u00a0\n\n - Own cross-functional product execution from scoping through delivery\u2014driving alignment between clinical, technical, and operational stakeholders to ensure features are launched on time and with impact.\n\n - Translate clinical workflows into buildable requirements by collaborating closely with nurses, physicians, engineers, and data scientists to ensure our tools work in the real world.\n\n - Drive process excellence by standing up and scaling repeatable systems for roadmap planning, sprint execution, testing, and post-release monitoring\u2014balancing speed with quality.\n\n - Advocate for the clinician end-user by keeping usability, alert fatigue, and workflow integration at the center of every product decision.\n\n - Lead voice-of-customer synthesis to transform feedback from health systems into structured insights that guide roadmap prioritization and product design.\n\n - Communicate clearly and consistently across teams\u2014owning documentation, timelines, and status updates to keep everyone focused and accountable.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\u00a0\n\n - 3+ years of clinical experience with 2+ years as a nurse informaticist with strong acumen of multiple EHR platforms (e.g. Epic, Cerner)\n\n - 3+ years working within health systems to optimizing clinical workflows for EHR solutions\n\n - Experience managing large, complex, cross-functional EHR platform projects\n\n - Rich understanding of data structures and flows to meet documentation requirements and integration needs for EHR integrated technical products\n\n - Experience writing test scripts for multiple personas\n\n - Experience working on projects with ambiguity and uncertainty\n   \n   Preferred Qualifications\n   \n\n - Experience working in a start up with the ability to wear multiple hats\n\n - Experience working in technical applications or optimizing products that drive clinical workflow efficiency (Figma, Jira, Miro, Parabol)\n\n - Experience with voice of customer process and creating positive vignettes for driving product adoption (e.g. using Pendo, Polly, Zendesk, Zeda.io http://Zeda.io or Guru)\n\n - Experience driving requirements and mapping from EHRs to a technical product solution (HL7 and FHIR)Experience working with data scientists to create data-driven product solutions. Experience querying data with SQL and building dashboards\n\n - Experience with advanced Slack integration tools (Slack AI, Agentforce, Workflow builder, Guru, Pylon, Clearfeed, Polly AI)\n\nBayesian Health provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\n\nThis policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "fa5bb751-d7ba-42df-8915-f66a770e5e43", "title": "Senior Software Engineer, Test Frameworks & Automation", "department": "Engineering", "team": "Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Remote - US Only", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-08-23T03:15:41.439+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressCountry": "United States"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/bayesianhealth/fa5bb751-d7ba-42df-8915-f66a770e5e43", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/bayesianhealth/fa5bb751-d7ba-42df-8915-f66a770e5e43/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h1><strong>Senior Software Engineer, Test Frameworks &amp; Automation</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h3><strong>In Brief</strong></h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re an early-stage startup on a mission to make healthcare proactive by empowering physicians, nurses, and care team members with real-time data to save lives.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You will play an instrumental role, working closely with product managers, clinicians, software engineers, data scientists, and regulatory, to ensure our clinical AI/ML products exceed enterprise health system quality standards and regulatory requirements for reliable, safe, and effective patient care.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Bayesian Health\u2019s mission is to improve patient outcomes by empowering clinicians with the insights they need to make the right decision for the right patient at the point-of-care.
