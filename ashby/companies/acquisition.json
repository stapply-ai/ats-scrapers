You are the operational force that clears the runway, keeps the signal high, and eliminates anything that slows him down.\n\nYour job is to protect time like it\u2019s gold, anticipate needs before they\u2019re spoken, and make sure nothing gets in the way of momentum. You create clarity, kill noise, and make speed possible.\n\nYou\u2019ll be embedded in a high-trust, high-performance culture where standards are high, feedback is direct, and speed is the baseline. If you thrive in the details, obsess over outcomes, and move faster than most people think \u2014 you\u2019ll be at home here.\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n - Own and manage an evolving set of professional and personal calendars.\n\n - Prioritize meetings, prep logistics, follow up action items, and ensure time is aligned with highest-leverage opportunities.\n\n - Serve as the Co-Founder\u2019s gatekeeper when it comes to how he leverages time.\n\n - Triage emails, manage communications, draft responses, and facilitate alignment with internal and external stakeholders \u2014 all with clarity and urgency.\n\n - Run point on weekly syncs with the Co-Founder, ensuring alignment on media content, marketing moves, business projects, as well as upcoming speaking engagements.\n\n - Partner on the upcoming book launch and all related post-launch initiatives.\n\n - Manage events, dinners, speaking trips, and conference appearances with polish and precision.\n\n - Must be available for occasional travel alongside the Co-Founder, as needed.\n\n - Lead business and personal travel planning \u2014 with backups, contingencies, and attention to detail that leaves nothing to chance.\n\n - Willingness to flex occasionally on evenings or Saturdays, based on what\u2019s needed.\n\n - You can handle high standards, direct feedback, and shifting targets without drama.\n\n - Step in wherever needed with a proactive mindset and strong sense of ownership \u2014 whether the task is personal or professional \u2014 demonstrating flexibility, problem-solving, and a willingness to take initiative when priorities shift or gaps appear.\n   \n\n\nRESULTS\n\n - You manage sensitive information and relationships with unshakable discretion, integrity, and professionalism.\n\n - The Co-Founder's calendar consistently reflects his highest-leverage priorities.\n\n - Nonessential time drains are eliminated, strategic blocks are protected, and energy allocation aligns with long-term goals.\n\n - Messages are triaged, responses are crafted with the Founder\u2019s voice, and only signal (never noise) reaches his attention.\n\n - Agendas are ready in advance, materials are at-hand, and action items are captured and closed without reminders.\n\n - Every trip \u2014 whether personal or business \u2014 is prepped with layered contingencies, clear itineraries, and zero details missed.\n\n - From scheduling appointments to home operations, personal responsibilities are managed with the same discipline as business.\n\n - You build systems to prevent chaos, follow through without nudging, and remove yourself as a bottleneck from every process you touch.\n   \n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - 7-10 YOE in an Executive or Personal Assistant role supporting founders, C-level execs, or high-net-worth individuals (bonus if in family office or high-velocity startups).\n\n - Elite Communicator. You write clearly. You speak directly. You match your tone to the context \u2014 no over-talking, no under-communicating. Just signal, no noise.\n\n - Bulletproof Discretion. You\u2019re a vault. You know what\u2019s sensitive, what\u2019s strategic, and what stays behind closed doors. You don\u2019t need reminders about what not to say.\n\n - High EQ. Zero Drama. You read people, rooms, and situations fast. You adjust without being asked and handle shifting dynamics with calm precision.\n\n - Outcome Ownership. You don\u2019t ask what to do next \u2014 you figure out what needs to be done. If it\u2019s in your lane, it\u2019s handled. If it\u2019s not, you find a way.\n\n - Fast Response Time. You move in real time, not in delay loops. You treat responsiveness as a signal of respect \u2014 and you're wired to be on, even when it\u2019s after hours.\n\n - Integrated but Clear. You can move seamlessly between personal and professional domains without losing clarity or boundaries. You know the difference between helpful and overstepping.\n\n - Pressure-Ready.
