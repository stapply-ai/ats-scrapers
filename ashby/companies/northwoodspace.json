If you've ever wanted to terraform an entire company's IT stack instead of clicking through admin panels, this is your role.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n - Design and implement Infrastructure as Code for identity management (Okta), device management (Intune/Jamf/FleetDM), and SaaS administration using Terraform, Python, or similar tools\n\n - Partner with Security Engineering to implement and maintain endpoint detection/response (CrowdStrike/SentinelOne), email security (Proofpoint/Mimecast), and zero-trust architecture\n\n - Develop self-service tools and Slack bots to eliminate common IT requests (password resets, access requests, software installations)\n\n - Provide hands-on IT support including new hire setup, desk deployment, A/V troubleshooting, and asset management while building automation to eliminate these manual tasks over time\n\n - Maintain and monitor hybrid infrastructure including on-premise servers, networking equipment, and cloud services through automated alerting and remediation\n\n - Create API integrations between Microsoft 365, Okta, Atlassian Cloud, Slack, and other core services\n\n - Document systems architecture and runbooks (as code where possible)\n\n - Handle escalations that genuinely require human intervention while continuously reducing that surface area\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n\n - 3+ years automating IT infrastructure and writing production code (Python, Go, PowerShell, or similar)\n\n - Demonstrated experience with Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation)\n\n - Strong background in identity providers and SSO/SAML (Okta, Auth0, or Azure AD)\n\n - Experience with endpoint security platforms and security operations workflows\n\n - Proven track record of automating employee lifecycle management and access controls\n\n - API-first mindset with experience integrating SaaS platforms programmatically\n\n - Experience managing Windows, macOS, and Linux systems at scale\n\n - Must be able to work on-site in Torrance, CA\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\n - Experience in aerospace, defense, or other regulated industries\n\n - Background in DevOps/SRE with understanding of CI/CD pipelines\n\n - Familiarity with compliance frameworks (SOC2, CMMC, ITAR)\n\n - Experience with configuration management (Ansible, Puppet, Chef)\n\n - Knowledge of network automation and software-defined networking\n\n - Contributions to open-source IT automation tools\n\n - Experience scaling IT operations from startup to enterprise\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nTo conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.\n\nNorthwood is an Equal Opportunity Employer; employment with Northwood is governed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications and will not be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, gender, national origin/ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, mental or physical disability or any other legally protected status.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$110K \u2013 $160K", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$110K - $160K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "caac39b5-71f0-4a76-81c2-a41175e0685c", "tierSummary": "Estimated Base Salary $110K \u2013 $160K", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d465cee7-81f4-46be-b70d-2b00974993c2", "summary": "Estimated Base Salary $110K \u2013 $160K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 110000, "maxValue": 160000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 110000, "maxValue": 160000}]}}, {"id": "af609880-1e6c-4f89-8594-3c593f6eba0f", "title": "Electrical Engineer", "department": "Electrical", "team": "Electrical", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Torrance, CA", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-10-06T20:15:37.463+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": null, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "California", "addressCountry": "USA", "addressLocality": "Los Angeles, CA"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/northwoodspace/af609880-1e6c-4f89-8594-3c593f6eba0f", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/northwoodspace/af609880-1e6c-4f89-8594-3c593f6eba0f/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>About Northwood</strong>:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Northwood is on a mission to transform connectivity between earth and space and bring the benefits of space to the masses through innovations in space communications technologies.

you're building custom security solutions\n\n - Experience implementing defensive controls for endpoints, SaaS apps, and infrastructure that operates in environments where traditional security assumptions don't apply\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n - Experience building large-scale log ingestion and storage pipelines that can handle massive data volumes from distributed ground stations\n\n - Hands-on experience with SIEM (Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel, Panther) and endpoint security solutions (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) in production environments\n\n - Strong Linux experience in production environments - Our ground stations run custom distributions\n\n - Knowledge of DFARS compliance and government contracting security requirements - You've worked where \"move fast and break things\" meets \"don't break national security\"\n\n - Familiarity with EMASS or similar government assessment tools\n\n - Demonstrated ability to own complex security projects that directly impact national security missions and interface with government customers who trust you with their most sensitive operations\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nTo conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.\n\nNorthwood is an Equal Opportunity Employer;
