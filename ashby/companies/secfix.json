We help SMBs automate ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months. Our platform integrates with a company\u2019s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain compliant.\n\nWe grew fast and are looking for skilled engineers to help us improve and scale our product. Check our culture guide.\n\nWhy you should join Secfix\n\nSecfix is an early-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We\u2019re a fun, close-knit team on a mission to become the European compliance automation leader.\n\nWe grew from 0 revenue to >1M$ ARR within two years and most of our costs are already covered by revenue. Now we are looking to grow further and faster.\n\nOur trajectory is backed by top investors (4.4M$ raised), including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.\n\nAs a Senior Backend Engineer, you will help shape and build every product we deliver to real customers: CTOs, COOs and engineering teams of small and medium businesses. You will also be part of growing a high-performance fully remote software startup.\n\nWho are we looking for?\n\nWe're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride in building actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily \u2014 and who bring a design-first mindset (plan before coding) to ensure scalable, maintainable systems. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.\n\nWe understand that startup life can be demanding, but we believe it doesn\u2019t have to be stressful. Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we\u2019ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You\u2019re ambitious, independent and growth-oriented\n\n - You\u2019re comfortable with startup life ambiguity, adapting to changing priorities based on customer and market feedback, and wearing multiple hats\n\n - You bring senior talent to our team with 5+ years of equivalent experience\n\n - You\u2019re comfortable collaborating and communicating in a remote environment, especially in writing and with Loom. You understand that working independently doesn't mean working alone. Remember, it requires more pro-active communication than working in the office\n\n - You can mentor other developers and do code reviews.\n\n - You know how to balance speed and quality and how to build leverage in your work through automation, abstractions and good software design and architecture\n\n - You\u2019re excited not only to use AI tools like Cursor, or Claude Code consciously \u2014 not just for speed, but for better design, refactoring, and testing but also building AI tools.\n\nYou should not apply if:\n\n - You need a lot of processes to tell you what to do or you're comfortable only picking up tickets from a JIRA board\n\n - You are not disciplined and organized in how you document and communicate your work with collegues\n\n - You only want to write code and don\u2019t really care about the bigger picture and customers\n\n - You don\u2019t want to test, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot your own code\n\n - You don\u2019t want to lead your own projects, but rather be led by someone else\n\n - You don't want to collaborate closely with other areas of the business or engage with users when needed\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do day-to-day\n\n - You\u2019ll be the go-to person for all things backend in your product area\n\n - You\u2019ll work closely with the CTO and the Tech Lead to set technical direction\n\n - You\u2019ll work closely with our product and design teams and with our customers to identify, plan, design, build and ship features on schedule\n\n - You\u2019ll deploy, monitor, troubleshoot, debug, support, maintain and evolve features and code under your responsibility\n\n - You\u2019ll leverage AI-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to accelerate development, debugging, and testing.\n\n - You\u2019ll own and maintain product and technical documentation\n\n - You\u2019ll support other team members on your area of expertise, mentor and develop junior engineers\n\n - You\u2019ll follow company's culture and communication guidelines\n\n - Live by our values https://www.secfix.com/about-us\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need\n\n - 5+ years of of industry experience as a full-time backend or product engineer, building user-facing products:\n   \n   - Strong object oriented programming fundamentals in Java\n   \n   - Spring Boot, Hibernate (or equivalent) experience\n   \n   - Relational Database Design and SQL optimisation\n   \n   - Testing, monitoring and troubleshooting\n   \n   - Ability to design and build backend systems that can scale both in supported features and concurrent usage\n   \n   - Previous experience with Golang and/or Typescript is a bonus\n\n - Experience with owning features end-to-end, from idea to execution to delivery in production\n\n - Experience with communicating software design ideas and adapting to feedback before jumping into coding\n\n - Extensive experience with AI-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude), you know their strengths, weaknesses, and how to validate outputs.\n\nPreferred (bonus)\n\n - Experience working at fully remote companies\n\n - Experience working on early stage startups\n\n - Built functional AI features (especially if deployed to production) or integrated AI with backend systems.\n\n - 0.5-1 year of software engineering experience in high growth VC-funded startups.\n\nNot every candidate will tick every box.

We help SMBs automate ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months. Our platform integrates with a company\u2019s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain compliant.\n\nWe grew fast and are looking for skilled engineers to help us improve and scale our product. Check our culture guide.\n\nWhy you should join Secfix\n\nSecfix is an early-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We\u2019re a fun, close-knit team on a mission to become the European compliance automation leader.\n\nWe grew from 0 revenue to >1M$ ARR within two years and most of our costs are already covered by revenue. Now we are looking to grow further and faster.\n\nOur trajectory is backed by top investors (4.4M$ raised), including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.\n\nAs a Senior Backend Engineer, you will help shape and build every product we deliver to real customers: CTOs, COOs and engineering teams of small and medium businesses. You will also be part of growing a high-performance fully remote software startup.\n\nWho are we looking for?\n\nWe're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride in building actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily \u2014 and who bring a design-first mindset (plan before coding) to ensure scalable, maintainable systems. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.\n\nWe understand that startup life can be demanding, but we believe it doesn\u2019t have to be stressful. Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we\u2019ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You\u2019re ambitious, independent and growth-oriented\n\n - You\u2019re comfortable with startup life ambiguity, adapting to changing priorities based on customer and market feedback, and wearing multiple hats\n\n - You bring senior talent to our team with 5+ years of equivalent experience\n\n - You\u2019re comfortable collaborating and communicating in a remote environment, especially in writing and with Loom. You understand that working independently doesn't mean working alone. Remember, it requires more pro-active communication than working in the office\n\n - You can mentor other developers and do code reviews.\n\n - You know how to balance speed and quality and how to build leverage in your work through automation, abstractions and good software design and architecture\n\n - ou\u2019re excited not only to use AI tools like Cursor, or Claude Code consciously \u2014 not just for speed, but for better design, refactoring, and testing but also building AI tools.\n\nYou should not apply if:\n\n - You need a lot of processes to tell you what to do or you're comfortable only picking up tickets from a JIRA board\n\n - You are not disciplined and organized in how you document and communicate your work with collegues\n\n - You only want to write code and don\u2019t really care about the bigger picture and customers\n\n - You don\u2019t want to test, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot your own code\n\n - You don\u2019t want to lead your own projects, but rather be led by someone else\n\n - You don't want to collaborate closely with other areas of the business or engage with users when needed\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do day-to-day\n\n - You\u2019ll be the go-to person for all things backend in your product area\n\n - You\u2019ll work closely with the CTO and the Tech Lead to set technical direction\n\n - You\u2019ll work closely with our product and design teams and with our customers to identify, plan, design, build and ship features on schedule\n\n - You\u2019ll deploy, monitor, troubleshoot, debug, support, maintain and evolve features and code under your responsibility\n\n - You\u2019ll leverage AI-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to accelerate development, debugging, and testing.\n\n - You\u2019ll own and maintain product and technical documentation\n\n - You\u2019ll support other team members on your area of expertise, mentor and develop junior engineers\n\n - You\u2019ll follow company's culture and communication guidelines\n\n - Live by our values https://www.secfix.com/about-us\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need\n\n - 5-8 years of of industry experience as a backend or product engineer, building user-facing products:\n\n - Strong object oriented programming fundamentals in Java\n\n - Spring Boot, Hibernate (or equivalent) experience\n\n - Relational Database Design and SQL optimisation\n\n - Testing, monitoring and troubleshooting\n\n - Ability to design and build backend systems that can scale both in supported features and concurrent usage\n\n - Previous experience with Golang and/or Typescript is a bonus\n\n - Experience with owning features end-to-end, from idea to execution to delivery in production\n\n - Experience with communicating software design ideas and adapting to feedback before jumping into coding\n\n - Extensive experience with AI-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude), you know their strengths, weaknesses, and how to validate outputs.\n\nPreferred (bonus)\n\n - Experience working at fully remote companies\n\n - Experience working on early stage startups\n\n - Built functional AI features (especially if deployed to production) or integrated AI with backend systems.\n\n - 0.5-1 year of software engineering experience in high growth VC-funded startups.\n\nNot every candidate will tick every box.
