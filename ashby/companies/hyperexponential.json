We\u2019re changing that. Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\n\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we\u2019re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world\u2019s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\n\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it.

They don\u2019t Google for ideas for what to buy. They consult with names they already trust.\n\nOur brand has to show up with the right people at the right time, and be trusted and impossible to ignore. It must be effortless to recommend and formidable in presence.\n\nThe bar is high: creative excellence, sharp storytelling, and experiences - digital and physical -that cut through the noise of AI-generated sameness.\n\nAs Corporate Marketing Director, you\u2019ll work directly with David (our CMO & Chief Strategy Officer) to shape hx\u2019s identity and positioning. You\u2019ll use AI as leverage, not a crutch. And you\u2019ll build a brand people love before they even know they need our product offerings.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Position hx so our content stands out in a sea of AI noise - driving awareness, consideration and preference.\n\n - Make our website the best in category. Not a brochure. A source of high quality content that our target audiences choose to spend time with.\n\n - Lead a cross-functional creative team at hx that blends human expertise with AI, leveraging AI for speed and prototyping, while ensuring final campaigns are curated and shipped with human judgement and distinctive taste.\n\n - Produce bold multimedia and integrated campaigns at scale. Original, high quality, impossible to ignore.\n\n - Foster authentic relationships that AI can\u2019t summarize. These include the founder brand, hx Live Summit series, and customer advisory boards.\n\n - Build influence with industry voices. Track it with share of voice and mentions, not vanity metrics.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - You\u2019ve built creative campaigns that drove brand and revenue impact, not just impressions.\n\n - You\u2019ve owned brand or product marketing in a high-growth company and balanced storytelling with commercial results.\n\n - You\u2019ve brought AI tools into creative workflows without losing originality or taste.\n\n - You\u2019ve led high-performing teams and grown leaders.\n\n - You\u2019ve worked across Marketing, Sales, Product, and Success to launch campaigns that excited diverse audiences (customers, prospects, employees, investors) and moved them emotionally (as well as shaped their perceptions of a brand).\n\n - You\u2019ve thrived in fast, messy environments where boundaries get pushed.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You need a playbook. This role is about writing the playbook for how B2B brands win in the AI era.\n\n - You think AI product great copy (or video or images). Here, AI speeds things up - but taste and craft still win.\n\n - You want comfortable, predictable work.

We design controls, shape culture, and guide decisions that protect our business, our customers, and the wider industry.\n\nAs a Staff Security Engineer, you\u2019ll play a pivotal role in building hx\u2019s security function from the ground up. You\u2019ll drive technical direction, design systems that are secure by design, and collaborate across engineering and product teams to embed security early in every decision. This role combines technical depth, influence, and cross-functional leadership to make security an enabler of growth and a differentiator for hx in the market.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Build hx's security programme from the ground up, setting direction for security architecture, compliance, and incident response as we scale globally.\n\n - Design and implement security controls across AWS cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes workloads, and our multi-product platform, ensuring systems are secure by design.\n\n - Integrate security into engineering workflows by embedding automated security testing, vulnerability management, and threat detection into CI/CD pipelines without slowing teams down.\n\n - Lead or contribute to compliance initiatives (SOC2, ISO27001) by implementing technical controls and working cross-functionally with legal, engineering, and business teams to enable enterprise sales.\n\n - Build security automation and tooling by writing code and scripts that scale security practices, detect vulnerabilities, and enforce policies efficiently.\n\n - Partner with Engineering Managers, Principal Engineers, and Product Managers to embed security thinking early in design and architecture decisions.\n\n - Act as a trusted voice in critical moments: responding to incidents, unblocking teams on security questions, and keeping high-stakes initiatives secure and on track.\n\n - Assess and secure AI-powered systems across hx's platform, implementing controls that enable safe adoption of AI while mitigating risks like prompt injection, data leakage, and model vulnerabilities.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - Built or significantly contributed to security programmes from the ground up, establishing foundational security controls, compliance readiness, and incident response capabilities.\n\n - Designed and implemented security architecture for cloud-based distributed systems (AWS or equivalent), including multi-account strategies, identity and access management, network security, and data protection.\n\n - Driven technical security improvements by writing code, building tools, and implementing controls that scaled with company growth.\n\n - Integrated security into development workflows through DevSecOps practices including automated testing, secrets management, container security, and infrastructure-as-code security.\n\n - Led or supported compliance initiatives (SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, or similar), mapping technical controls to compliance requirements and guiding teams through audit cycles.\n\n - Built trust with engineering teams by contributing technically and making security collaborative and frictionless.\n\n - Balanced security rigor with business goals, making risk-based trade-offs that enabled growth while protecting customers and the business.\n\n - Evaluated security implications of AI/ML systems, including understanding AI-specific risks and implementing controls to secure them.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You prefer narrow ownership of security tools over building cross-functional culture and influence.\n\n - You view security as primarily compliance-driven rather than enabling business outcomes and customer trust.\n\n - You lead through authority and mandates rather than influence, collaboration, and making engineers\u2019 lives easier.\n\n - You\u2019re more comfortable writing policies than writing code, or can\u2019t dive deep into complex systems to implement security controls.\n\n - If reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nAt hx, we\u2019re committed to salary transparency. You\u2019ll always have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent Partner will share details with you during initial conversations - and we\u2019re working towards publishing salary information for all roles globally.\n\nBecause we\u2019re building at the intersection of technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don\u2019t always map neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to design compensation that\u2019s competitive in the market, fair across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.\n\nEquity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a significant component of total compensation.

These are the decisions that shape real-world outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space, autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities recover after major storms.\n\nUntil now, insurers have been making billion-dollar decisions using outdated tools. We\u2019re changing that. Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\n\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we\u2019re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world\u2019s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\n\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn\u2019t tied to title or tenure; it\u2019s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT THE SOLUTIONS ARCHITECTURE TEAM\n\nThe Solutions Architecture team provides the technical expertise that bridges customer needs with our platform\u2019s capabilities. From early sales conversations through onboarding and into live consultancy, the team ensures our customers can integrate and use hx Renew to its full potential.\n\nAs a Associate Solutions Architect, you\u2019ll be a trusted advisor to customers, combining technical depth with commercial awareness to build lasting partnerships. You\u2019ll learn the platform inside-out, understand its limits (and when they can be pushed), and showcase what\u2019s possible. Alongside client delivery, you\u2019ll also create reusable assets and resources that make the team more efficient and scalable.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\n - Run discovery workshops with prospects and customers, mapping their needs to our integration and onboarding playbooks.\n\n - Build trusted relationships with key stakeholders from underwriters to CTOs to enable smooth sales and onboarding.\n\n - Support RFPs, RFIs, and due diligence processes, and create proofs-of-concept to demonstrate hx Renew\u2019s capabilities.\n\n - Guide customers through onboarding, delivering integration plans and providing consultancy for complex challenges.\n\n - Act as \u201cCustomer Zero,\u201d working with Product Engineering to test new features and feed back improvements.\n\n - Develop and maintain reusable assets (integration libraries, playbooks, demos, and presentations) to scale our impact.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - Built a solid technical foundation whether, through work experience, personal projects, or education, with exposure to programming (ideally Python) or technical problem-solving.\n\n - Gained familiarity with some core technical concepts, such as APIs, networking basics, databases, or authentication/authorisation.\n\n - Communicated ideas clearly, whether that\u2019s presenting a project, writing documentation, or explaining something technical to a non-technical audience.\n\n - Worked with others to solve problems, this could be on a project team, at university, or in a customer-facing environment.\n\n - Shown curiosity and initiative: you enjoy figuring things out, asking \u201cwhy?\u201d, and experimenting to find better ways of doing things.\n\n - Developed a comfort with ambiguity and change, and you\u2019re motivated by the chance to grow quickly in a fast-moving environment.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You prefer focusing only on technical delivery rather than building client relationships.\n\n - You\u2019re uncomfortable moving between high-level architecture and low-level implementation.\n\n - You prefer following detailed instructions instead of experimenting, iterating, and adapting quickly.\n\nIf reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nAt hx, we\u2019re committed to salary transparency. You\u2019ll always have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent Partner will share details with you during initial conversations - and we\u2019re working towards publishing salary information for all roles globally.\n\nBecause we\u2019re building at the intersection of technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don\u2019t always map neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to design compensation that\u2019s competitive in the market, fair across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.\n\nEquity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a significant component of total compensation.

AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn\u2019t tied to title or tenure; it\u2019s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nAt hx, our Sales function is driving exceptional growth and proving that complex technology can reshape entire industries. We continued scaling revenue in 2024 with approximately 60% annual growth, building partnerships with globally recognized brands like Markel, Munich Re, and Aviva. Our focus on large multi-year deals, with an average total contract value of $1.8 million scaling up to $5 million in annual recurring revenue, reflects the scale of transformation we're delivering.\n\nSales at hx means engaging with the sharpest minds in insurance across extended cycles, because the decisions we're influencing reshape how billion-dollar industries operate. Our Strategic Team collaborates with the most demanding clients in the world, and our top Account Executives achieved up to 180% of their quotas last year, not through quick wins, but by tackling complex challenges that seemed impossible to others.\n\nWe're looking for a Strategic Senior Account Executive who thrives on intellectual challenge and can build credibility with actuaries, underwriters, IT teams, and C-suite executives while driving meaningful change. This is your opportunity to own significant outcomes and help reshape an industry undergoing its biggest transformation in 300 years.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\n - Own your territory by developing and executing a strategic sales plan to achieve around $2.5m in revenue, building the relationships and pipeline that drive long-term industry transformation.\n\n - Become a trusted advisor to senior decision-makers, including C-Suite executives who are reshaping their industries, positioning hx as the partner that solves what others can't even comprehend.\n\n - Navigate complexity with precision by qualifying opportunities that can close within 9-12 months while nurturing the sophisticated, high-value relationships that define generational partnerships.\n\n - Orchestrate brilliance across our pre-sales engineers and professional services teams to deliver solutions that stretch what clients thought was possible in their industry.\n\n - Build and sustain momentum by generating and advancing a healthy pipeline of opportunities within your named accounts, ensuring a balance between in-year closable deals and long-term strategic relationships.\n\n - Shape the future by representing hx at industry events, showcasing how we're setting new standards and building relationships with the leaders who will define tomorrow's risk landscape.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - 3-5 years of B2B SaaS solution selling experience in complex, multi-stakeholder environments where you've thrived on the challenge of changing how businesses fundamentally operate.\n\n - Exceptional communication and demonstration skills that bring complex technology to life for diverse audiences. You translate technical capability into business value that resonates and drives decision-making.\n\n - Consistently exceeded a $2 million sales quota through curiosity, persistence, and the courage to pursue opportunities others might abandon. You don't just hit targets - you set new standards for what's achievable.\n\n - Strong experience with strategic sales methodologies like MEDDICC and Challenger, using them to navigate ambiguity and create value through every conversation with sophisticated clients.\n\n - Natural ownership mentality with an instinct for taking initiative and seeing what needs doing before being asked. You consistently raise standards for yourself and others, driven by personal excellence.\n\n - Collaborative approach across technical and commercial teams, understanding that the best outcomes emerge when diverse expertise works together towards shared goals.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You're more comfortable with predictable processes and established playbooks rather than the challenge of building and adapting in a rapidly evolving environment.\n\n - You prefer straightforward targets and conventional approaches over tackling complex problems that require strategic thinking and persistence.\n\n - You're looking for a transactional sales role rather than one where you're expected to think strategically, take full ownership, and grow in ways that will stretch your capabilities.\n\n - If reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energized, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work.

Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT OUR PRICING & INNOVATION TEAM\n\nMost actuarial roles are tied to a single portfolio in a single organisation. At hyperexponential, you\u2019ll apply your expertise across many insurers, seeing first-hand how the most advanced players are transforming their pricing and shaping what best practice looks like for the wider market.\n\nAs a Senior Pricing Actuary in our Pricing & Innovation team, you\u2019ll sit at the centre of how hx defines and delivers next-generation pricing. This isn\u2019t a back-office actuarial role. You\u2019ll partner directly with underwriters, actuaries, and product leaders-both inside hx and at our clients - to understand their challenges, design solutions, and cast a vision for how pricing and underwriting can evolve.\n\nThe Pricing & Innovation team bridges actuarial depth with technical delivery and product insight. In this role, you\u2019ll bring credibility in pricing, as well as curiosity about new methods, data, and technology, helping our clients adopt AI-enabled workflows and portfolio intelligence as part of their day-to-day practice.\n\nhx itself is evolving rapidly - expanding into new lines, geographies, and use cases, with AI and automation redefining what\u2019s possible. Your job is to help clients keep pace with that evolution, while feeding their insights back into our platform to ensure hyperexponential stays at the leading edge of insurance pricing.\n\nThink of it as a hybrid between in-house and consulting: you\u2019ll need the technical expertise to engage credibly with senior actuaries and CUOs, but also the consulting mindset to guide transformations, influence stakeholders, and shape how entire organisations adopt change.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Act as a subject matter expert in pricing across commercial, specialty, and reinsurance - joining complex client and sales conversations, running best-practice workshops, and representing hx at industry forums.\n\n - Partner with senior stakeholders (Chief Actuaries, CUOs, Heads of Pricing) as a trusted advisor - guiding strategic conversations on pricing transformation, workflows, and portfolio strategy, and stepping in to resolve challenges with \u201camber-red\u201d accounts.\n\n - Support customers through their transformation journeys - helping deploy new models, re-engineer workflows, and embed modern pricing processes, while building practical assets (reference models, reporting pipelines, workflow enhancements) that accelerate value from hx Renew.\n\n - Feed back client and market insights into hx - informing our product roadmap and ensuring we prioritise solutions that matter most to the business, not just technically.\n\n - Contribute to innovation projects - exploring new methods, data sources, or AI applications that reshape pricing and underwriting.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - Be a newly or recently qualified actuary with pricing experience in commercial, specialty, or reinsurance markets (reinsurance exposure is a plus, but not essential).\n\n - Contributed to the development or enhancement of pricing models, with some experience of how models are applied in live underwriting.\n\n - Shown the ability to work effectively with stakeholders\u2014whether peers or senior colleagues\u2014by explaining technical work clearly and supporting decisions that go beyond the model.\n\n - Demonstrated an interest in the commercial impact of actuarial work, whether through project experience, client-facing exposure, or transformation initiatives.\n\n - Worked hands-on with actuarial and analytical tools (e.g. R, Python, data pipelines), and comfortable discussing methods, assumptions, and trade-offs with rigour.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You prefer established processes and aren\u2019t motivated to explore how AI, automation, or portfolio intelligence could reshape pricing.\n\n - You\u2019d rather focus narrowly on model-building than engage clients in shaping their wider pricing transformation.\n\n - You need rigid playbooks and step-by-step instructions, rather than the chance to help define what \u201cbest practice\u201d looks like for the market.\n\n - If reading our Culture Doc https://hx.wiki leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - \u00a35,000 training and conference budget for individual and group development.\n\n - 25 days of holiday plus 8 bank holidays (33 days total).\n\n - Company pension scheme via Penfold.\n\n - Mental health support and therapy via Spectrum.life http://Spectrum.life.\n\n - Individual well-being allowance via Juno https://www.withjuno.com/.\n\n - Private healthcare insurance through AXA.\n\n - Income protection and Life Insurance.\n\n - Cycle to Work Scheme\n\n\nADDITIONAL PERKS\n\n - Top-spec equipment (laptop, screens, adjustable desks, etc.).\n\n - Regular hackathons, lunch & learns, and socials, both remote and in-person, to foster collaboration and creativity.\n\n - Team breakfasts and lunches, fully stocked snacks and drinks, and a fun, creative office at The Ministry https://theministry.com/.\n\n - Access to cutting-edge AI tools and experimentation budget, giving you the freedom to test, learn, and innovate ahead of the market.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\n 1.

Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT THE MARKETING TEAM\n\nJob mission: reinvent growth marketing for the AI era.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for someone exceptionally ambitious to work directly with the Chief Marketing & Strategy Officer. This is not a demand-gen leadership role. It\u2019s not marketing ops. It\u2019s something entirely new.\n\nYou will design and deploy AI teammates across the marketing org. These AI systems will personalize every touchpoint, automate the messy stuff, and scale faster than humans ever could - while keeping the human insight and creativity that makes great marketing actually work.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Help the CMO build the first true human + AI marketing team. That means governance, upskilling people, and making AI adoption part of the culture. Success = the rate at which your teammates actually use AI agents and the combined impact they have together (where 1+1=3).\n\n - Oversee GTM Engineers who embed AI into the marketing stack, so campaigns run themselves, sales workflows move faster, and customers feel like we built the product just for them.\n\n - Conceive and deploy AI teammates - for lead intelligence, content personalization, outbound that drive efficiency, cut costs, and create revenue streams others can\u2019t see yet.\n\n - Work across Marketing, Sales, Product, and Success to shorten the sales cycle and turn pipeline into revenue faster.\n\n - Never stop experimenting. Use data, predictive models, and AI insights to keep pushing CAC down and conversion up at every stage of the funnel.\n\nThis role is not about running individual campaigns. It\u2019s about rewriting the playbook for how growth happens.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - You have scaled B2B demand gen into real pipeline - millions, not \u201cleads.\u201d\n\n - You\u2019ve built and led teams that punch above their weight, and you\u2019ve grown leaders, not just followers.\n\n - You\u2019ve wired AI and automation into marketing, turning messy manual work into systems that actually scale.\n\n - You\u2019ve worked side-by-side with Sales and SDRs to shorten cycles and close more deals.\n\n - You\u2019ve owned budgets and proved ROI - not just with dashboards, but with strategy that moves numbers.\n\n - You don\u2019t fold under pressure. When others stop, you find another gear.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - Your definition of AI marketing is a custom GPT.\n\n - You want a playbook handed to you. This job is about writing the playbook.\n\n - You need calm, predictable work. This role is fast, messy, and evolving - and that\u2019s exactly the fun.\n\n - If reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - $6000 training and conference budget for individual and group development.\n\n - Full medical, dental, vision package to fit your needs\n\n - Mental health support via Spring Health and Rula\n\n - Access to One Medical\n\n - Flexible vacation policy; work hard and take time when you need it\n\n - Pet discount plans, retirement plan (401K), and discount programs available to employees\n\nAdditional perks\n\n - Top-spec equipment (laptop, screens, adjustable desks, etc.).\n\n - Regular hackathons, lunch & learns, and socials, both remote and in-person, to foster collaboration and creativity.\n\n - Team breakfasts and lunches, fully stocked snacks and drinks, and a fun, creative office at WeWork - 500, 7th Avenue.\n\n - Access to cutting-edge AI tools and experimentation budget, giving you the freedom to test, learn, and innovate ahead of the market.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\n 1. Talent Partner Screen - 45 minutes\n\n 2. Hiring Manager Interview - 1 hour\n\n 3. Skills Assessment - 1 hour\n\n 4. Meet the Team - x2, 30 minute coffee chats.\n\n 5.

Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\n\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we\u2019re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world\u2019s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\n\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn\u2019t tied to title or tenure; it\u2019s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT TEAM\n\nThe hyperexponential Model Development team (MDT) is a unique blend of engineers, actuaries, mathematicians and data scientists. We don\u2019t take on traditional \u201ctransformations\u201d (we have brilliant partners for that) \u2013 we specialise in handling only the most difficult and interesting problems our customers face, where only a combination of technical depth, market expertise and hx Renew knowledge will do.\n\nThe MDT are the experts' experts of hx Renew, knowing it top-to-bottom, inside-out \u2013 both breadth and depth. You\u2019ll learn its limits and which can be pushed. You\u2019ll uncover every trick in the book, the secret combinations, and the shortcuts. You\u2019ll combine all of this with a growing knowledge of insurance technology to present 'the art of the possible' to our customers and help shape cutting-edge tech, while working alongside some of the brightest, most ambitious people in the tech and insurance industries.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Learn the hx Renew modelling platform, you\u2019ll ship your first models independently within days.\n\n - Build and maintain models in Python for seamless integration, applying modern approaches.\n\n - Work directly with customer actuarial teams, partner developers and internal colleagues to solve complex coding problems.\n\n - Contribute to the development of best-practice guidance for Python model building.\n\n - Review and test models as part of our day-to-day quality assurance process.\n\n - Support the creation and improvement of our internal and external training and development materials.\n\n - Always look for ways to refine and improve our model development standards and ways of working.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - Developed strong Python skills, we\u2019ll help you level up, but you\u2019ll need production-grade experience to start with impact.\n\n - Applied predictive modelling or advanced analytics methods (exposure to insurance or reinsurance pricing techniques is a bonus, but not essential).\n\n - Shown a self-starter attitude, operating autonomously in a high-trust, high-accountability environment, and proactively driving your own development.\n\n - Demonstrated a passion for experimenting with new approaches and technologies, through work or personal projects.\n   \n   \n   \n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You prefer following detailed instructions rather than experimenting and finding your own approach.\n\n - You are uncomfortable working directly with non-technical stakeholders to understand their challenges.\n\n - You avoid tackling ambiguous or open-ended problems where the solution isn\u2019t obvious.\n\nIf reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nAt hx, we\u2019re committed to salary transparency.

These are the decisions that shape real-world outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space, autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities recover after major storms.\n\nUntil now, insurance has been making billion-dollar decisions using outdated tools. We\u2019re changing that. Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\n\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we\u2019re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world\u2019s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\n\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn\u2019t tied to title or tenure; it\u2019s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT THE HXAI TEAM\n\nOur mission is bold: to redefine how the insurance industry builds software and makes decisions, powered by generative AI. We are creating the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer-programmer for enterprise insurance - a step change in how insurers design, build, and scale critical models.\n\nAs part of hxAI, you\u2019ll join one of only a handful of companies globally shaping how AI transforms software development. While others are building general-purpose coding assistants, we\u2019re charting new territory by creating an AI peer-programmer with deep, domain-specific expertise.\n\nIn this context, the Staff Engineer role is pivotal. You won\u2019t be tied to a single team: instead, you\u2019ll work across domains, systems, and initiatives. From guiding architectural evolution and tackling platform-wide scalability challenges to shaping patterns for AI integration, your work will directly influence hx\u2019s technical strategy and growth trajectory.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - Lead high-impact, cross-cutting engineering initiatives, setting direction in early-stage or ambiguous projects and helping teams move fast with confidence.\n\n - Shape hx\u2019s technical future by contributing to the Engineering Vision, raising the bar on quality, sustainability, and long-term resilience.\n\n - Partner with Engineering Managers, Principal Engineers, and Product Managers to align on strategy and empower teams delivering secure, scalable, high-performing software.\n\n - Provide architectural leadership across domains, ensuring systems are designed for scale, reliability, and future evolution.\n\n - Champion and scale engineering practices, embedding wins into org-wide standards that improve velocity, developer experience, and product reliability.\n\n - Act as a trusted voice in critical moments: resolving incidents, unblocking teams, and keeping high-stakes initiatives on track.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEED TO HAVE DONE\n\n - Designed and delivered scalable, secure, and resilient cloud-based distributed systems under real-world pressures.\n\n - Led cross-team technical initiatives that shaped architecture, influenced engineering practices, and moved business outcomes forward.\n\n - Balanced long-term technical vision with near-term business impact, making trade-offs with clarity and ownership.\n\n - Built trust with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, aligning strategy and delivery across teams.\n\n - Mentored engineers and influenced technical culture, supporting growth, curiosity, and continuous improvement.\n\n - Contributed to evolving an engineering vision, ensuring systems and practices were built to endure and scale.\n\n\nYOU\u2019RE UNLIKELY TO THRIVE HERE IF\n\n - You prefer narrow ownership of a single system over cross-team impact and influence.\n\n - You avoid ambiguity and prefer clear, predefined playbooks to navigate challenges.\n\n - You lead primarily through authority rather than influence, collaboration, and empathy.\n\nIf reading our Culture Document https://hx.wiki/ leaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you\u2019ll do your best work. We\u2019re building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nAt hx, we\u2019re committed to salary transparency.

These are the decisions that shape real-world outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space, autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities recover after major storms.\n\nUntil now, insurance has been making billion-dollar decisions using outdated tools. We\u2019re changing that. Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\n\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we\u2019re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world\u2019s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\n\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world\u2019s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\n\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn\u2019t tied to title or tenure; it\u2019s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you\u2019ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\n\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nMany actuarial careers are defined by deep expertise within a single company or portfolio. At hx, you\u2019ll take that expertise and broaden its impact - working across multiple insurers and seeing first-hand how the most sophisticated organisations are reshaping their pricing and underwriting. Instead of focusing on one perspective, you\u2019ll help shape best practice across an entire industry.\n\nAs an Actuarial Account Manager, your role sits at the heart of hx\u2019s Revenue organisation, where client success and commercial growth come together. This role puts actuarial credibility at the centre. You\u2019ll be a trusted partner to Chief Actuaries, Pricing Directors, and underwriting leaders, guiding them as they embed hx Renew and our wider platform across their businesses. Because clients see you as a peer, you\u2019ll influence both their technical approach and their strategic priorities - and in doing so, open the door to wider adoption, from new features to new lines and territories.\n\nhx itself is evolving fast.
