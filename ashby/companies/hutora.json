Our platform needs to integrate with a variety of client systems (HRIS, project management, productivity tools, etc.), and consolidate that data to drive insights and action. You will be responsible for building the pipelines to ingest data from these sources, transform and organise it in our data warehouse, and make it available to the application. This is a greenfield opportunity to set up a modern data stack from scratch.

Then transform it into clean, unified models that our product can use. You\u2019ll likely use a tool like dbt to create reusable data models, applying business logic so that messy real-world data becomes a set of well-defined tables. Basically, you turn chaos into order in the data layer.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Expose data to the product:</strong> Implement the mechanisms for our application and AI models to query this data efficiently.

Set up validations, monitoring, and alerting to ensure the data remains trustworthy. If a pipeline fails or data looks off, you catch it before it affects customers.

If we\u2019re implementing a new ML model that needs training data from a customer\u2019s usage patterns, you\u2019ll figure out how to pipe that in. If a customer wants to integrate a new data source, you\u2019ll help assess and integrate it. You may occasionally join technical calls with customers\u2019 IT teams to sort out integration details.
