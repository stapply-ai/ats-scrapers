We won a lot of awards: from US News Best Advisor in '20 to being featured by Apple. But, and I do mean this, we are nowhere close to reaching our ambitions. That chapter starts now.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nTo us, our team is everything. Nothing magical can happen without hiring magical people. We exert a crazy amount of effort to interview Titans. If you\u2019re excited by this, we'd love to meet you.\n\n - As a founding designer at Titan you will report to me, the Co-CEO.\n\n - You'll be sitting feet away from me, our CTO, and our engineering team ideating on features and shipping them at an insane pace. That means there's really high odds of you having a great idea in the morning and it actually being worked on the same day.\n\n - You'll define, explore, and solve our most complex challenges in close collaboration with teammates from engineering, product, brand, and investor relations teams.\n\n - You'll design a super engaging mobile product that people rave about.\n\n - You'll be super close to our users (clients).\n\n - You'll champion what great design means - both inwardly at our company and outwardly.\n\nFor the right person, this is \"the\" opportunity. You get to be on the ground floor, working with a high courage team, that actually wants to hear your craziest ideas and get them out the door as soon as we can.\nJoe here, signing off.
