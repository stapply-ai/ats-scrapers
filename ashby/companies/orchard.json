Our technology is used today across some of the largest farms in the nation.\n\n\nTHE ROLE:\n\nIn order to analyze billions of fruit on farms all year long, our advanced, tractor-mounted camera systems have to know a.) precisely where they are, and b.) everything about the fruit they are seeing.\n\nWe are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to build creative, practical, and robust solutions to ML/CV software and infrastructure problems, relating to training edge ML models on massive amounts of real-world farm image data collected by our camera systems.\n\nAbout the role:\u00a0\n\n - As an early engineer, you'll receive generous equity compensation\n\n - Full-time role at our San Francisco, CA office\n\n - Flexible working hours\n\n - Comprehensive Health, Vision, and Dental coverage, and we cover 100% of the premium\n\n - We move fast, and sometimes this means staying late or working weekends\u00a0\n\n - Our team is close-knit & highly driven, you\u2019ll work directly with our CEO and entire team\n\n - We\u2019re deeply motivated by the impact we\u2019re making \u2013 every line of code written or new system built means less food that goes to waste, and more people who are fed.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do:\n\n - Build and maintain scalable ETL pipelines for processing large, diverse image datasets collected from our tractor-mounted camera systems in farms.\n\n - Stay up-to-date with current literature in computer vision models and architectures, and apply relevant advancements to our systems.\n\n - Develop, deploy, and monitor infrastructure for model training, evaluation, and inference, both in the cloud and on edge devices.\n\n - Design and implement intelligent active sampling infrastructure to optimize data collection and improve model performance.\n\n - Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to integrate ML solutions into production robotics systems.\n\n - Work closely with agronomists and farmers to understand crop biology and translate domain knowledge into actionable ML features.\n\n - Be a generalist, supporting different parts of our software stack as needed.\n\nWhat makes you a good fit:\n\n - 3-5+ years of experience building production-grade data pipelines and ML infrastructure.\n\n - Proficiency in Python and experience with ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).\n\n - Strong experience with data engineering tools (e.g., Pandas, SQL, Apache Airflow, Spark).\n\n - Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).\n\n - Experience working with massive amounts of real-world training data.\n\n - Familiarity with MLops software and data engineering to ensure consistent deployment of ML models.\n\n - Ability to work independently, learn quickly, and operate in a dynamic environment\n\n - Enthusiasm for taking on multiple roles and responsibilities as our company grows.\n\nBonus Points:\n\n - Experience deploying & optimizing ML models to run fast on embedded compute like NVIDIA Jetson\n\n - Experience prototyping, evaluating, or deploying new ML/CV models on the edge.\n\nIf you're looking to help make a positive impact in the world by building the future of farming, come join us!", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$150K \u2013 $215K \u2022 0.1% \u2013 0.25%", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$150K -
