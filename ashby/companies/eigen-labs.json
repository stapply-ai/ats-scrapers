Built on our EigenLayer protocol, which has attracted billions in economic security, EigenCloud lets developers build applications with mathematical trust guarantees instead of pinky promises.\n\nFor developers, this means the best of both worlds: Use familiar cloud tools and programming environments while gaining blockchain-level verifiability. No need to rewrite your application in specialized blockchain languages or accept the limitations of smart contract environments.\n\nFor the world, this unlocks transformative applications:\n\n - AI systems with economic accountability for their outputs\n\n - Social platforms with verifiable, manipulation-resistant algorithms\n\n - Prediction markets that can resolve on any real-world event\n\n - Financial services with cryptographic transparency\n\n - Any application where trust and correctness matter\n\nWe're moving beyond crypto's current focus on digital money to make all digital interactions more trustworthy. With the fastest-growing developer ecosystem in crypto and backing from top-tier investors, we're at the inflection point where verifiable computing goes mainstream.\n\nReady to build the trust layer for the internet? We're looking for builders who want to solve hard problems and create technology that makes the digital world fundamentally more reliable.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nThis role will be on our EigenDA team: Provisioning data availability is one of the key components for scaling blockchains, and specifically Layer2 rollups. EigenDA is a secure, high throughput, and decentralized data availability (DA) service built on top of Ethereum using the EigenLayer restaking primitive. Developed by Eigen Labs, EigenDA is the first Autonomous Verifiable Service https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/twelve-early-projects-building-on-eigenlayer/ (AVS) https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/twelve-early-projects-building-on-eigenlayer/ to launch on EigenLayer. Restakers will be able to delegate stake to node operators performing validation tasks for EigenDA in exchange for service payments, and rollups will be able to post data to EigenDA in order to access lower transaction costs, higher transaction throughput, and secure composability across the EigenLayer ecosystem.\n\nYou will get an opportunity to develop deep expertise in rollup architecture and implementation while making upstream contributions to various rollup frameworks, where generic DA has yet to be developed. You will have a significant impact on DA's ability to provide value to Rollups, the EigenLayer product, the DeFi industry, and the world. All while working alongside the biggest projects and brightest minds in DeFi and Ethereum. If you\u2019re looking to collaborate with a talented team of engineers, driving innovation and inventing groundbreaking technologies, we look forward to hearing from you!\n\nThis is a full-time position that is fully remote or located with the largely Seattle-based team.
