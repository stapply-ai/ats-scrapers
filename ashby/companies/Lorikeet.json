The process is: 1) informal chats with Steve and Remy to hear our pitch and understand your interests and goals, 2) a ~two day paid work trial where you come in and ship with us. There\u2019s no better way for each of us to figure out if we like working together than to work together!\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND YOU\n\nWe\u2019re hiring for Business Operations in the United States. You\u2019ll be part of our generalist team, rotating through different parts of the company\u2014standing up and pressure-testing functions like growth, upsell motion, or partnerships. This is a high-context, high-agency role designed to grow with the needs of the business.\n\nThe essence of BizOps here is filling high-priority gaps as they emerge - incubating new functions, solving tough problems, and making things happen.\n\nThis is the right role for someone who thrives on autonomy and wants to build. You\u2019ll often be the only person online in your timezone, making fast, high-stakes decisions and directly managing relationships with key customers. If that energizes you, you'll do well here.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Act as an early BizOps hire, partnering closely with leadership to scale our presence globally\n\n - Rotate through high-priority business functions (e.g. growth, strategic finance, partnerships), standing up systems and playbooks as you go\n\n - Make fast, high-stakes decisions with limited structure or oversight\n\n - Design and implement scrappy, high-leverage solutions to problems across operations, GTM, and customer delivery\n\n\nTHE RIGHT CANDIDATE\n\nThe right candidate is equal parts operator, strategist, and builder. You\u2019re the kind of person who gets energy from ambiguity, moves quickly without sacrificing judgment, and can context-switch between tactical execution and big-picture thinking. You\u2019re comfortable navigating unstructured problems, and you have a bias toward action\u2014even when the path isn\u2019t fully mapped.\n\nYou might have experience in consulting, early-stage startups, or customer-facing roles at fast-moving tech companies. What matters most is that you can pick up new domains quickly, communicate clearly across functions, and take ownership of complex initiatives from day one.\n\nYou should be excited about the opportunity to rotate across the business, standing up new functions and helping us scale what works.\n\nYou might be fit if you:\n\n - You\u2019ve owned high-impact projects in fast-paced environments, with 5-8 YOE across MBB consulting, investment banking, PE or VC, or a high growth, venture-backed software startup.\n\n - You\u2019ve successfully launched new initiatives or processes from scratch (e.g. built a new onboarding flow, created internal dashboards, led a GTM experiment)\n\n - You\u2019ve directly managed enterprise or strategic customer relationships and know how to navigate ambiguity, unblock stakeholders, and drive toward outcomes\n\n - You\u2019ve led cross-functional workstreams, perhaps involving product, engineering, sales, or customer success\u2014and have the receipts to show you made things measurably better\n\n - Are excited by the chance to help build a category-defining AI company\n\nIf you don't quite match this and are from an under-represented background we strongly encourage you to reach out. We know first hand that diverse teams are higher performing and are proud that our team reflects a broad spectrum of identities and lived experiences.\n\nLorikeet uses Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) to assist in the candidate screening process. These systems help us efficiently review a high volume of applications by analyzing qualifications, skills, and experience against the requirements of the job description.\n\nThe use of AI is intended to enhance, not replace, human judgment. Final hiring decisions are made by human recruiters and hiring managers who review all relevant information, including AI-generated assessments, to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation.\n\nOur AI systems are regularly audited and monitored to prevent and mitigate bias.

Once teams are freed from reactive support, we want to help them tackle what's next: providing personalized concierge services to their customers.\n\nTo deliver this combination of powerful AI systems and well designed tooling we're leveraging Jamie's experience as an early member of Google's generative AI team and Steve's experience building for operational teams at Stripe, as well as the experience of our team who've joined us from places like Stripe, Canva, Atlassian, Dropbox and Dovetail.\n\nWe are growing fast, have paying customers, real revenue, an exciting roadmap and a strong sales pipeline. We\u2019ve raised over USD 50m from leading VCs and angel investors, including QED, Blackbird, Square Peg, Claire Hughes Johnson (ex Stripe COO), Cristina Cordova (Linear COO), Bob Van Winden (Stripe Head of Support), and Cos Nicolaescu (Brex CTO).\n\nOur global customers include:\n\n- The largest telehealth company in Australia\n\n- The largest bank for teens in the US\n\n- One of the largest NFT marketplaces by trading volume\n\n- One of the largest Web3 gaming companies\n\n- \u2026 and a handful of other enterprise customers with over 1 million support tickets a year.\n\n\nWHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY?\n\nHigh pay, high expectations, high performance. We're building a small, great team. We aim to match unicorn / scale up pay for OTE and offer uncapped commission with aggressive accelerators, as well as an equity stake in the business. Our team gets the same monthly updates we send to our investors because they're investors and owners too.\n\nOn the technical cutting edge. With our users we're defining what an AI-first SaaS product looks like. No one has figured out what the UI/UX, capabilities and data models of an AI first company are - it's white space for us to invent. The AI agent problems we're solving are beyond the cutting edge at the biggest research labs.\n\nNo nonsense recruitment process. The process is: 1) informal chats with Steve and Jamie to hear our pitch and understand your interests and goals, 2) a ~two day paid work trial where you come in and ship with us. There's no better way for each of us to figure out if we like working together than to work together!\n\nWarm, mature, flexible culture. Low ego, high trust team. No tolerance for 'talented jerks'. We embrace a) working efficiently, and b) working flexible hours to fit in life priorities outside of work. We're committed to building a diverse team and really encourage folks from underrepresented backgrounds to reach out - we value user obsession and eagerness to learn over traditional credentials.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND YOU\n\nThis is a foundational sales opportunity to join Lorikeet's nascent Account Executive team. You'll be instrumental in driving our growth by securing new enterprise customers and expanding our presence in key markets. You'll work directly with our technical founders to refine our sales strategy, establish the playbook for future sales team members, and help grow the team. We\u2019ve been selling the product so we know the value of sales perspectives in product development, and you\u2019ll have a seat at the table in shaping our product strategy and roadmap.\n\nYou'll be selling a transformative AI solution that delivers immediate and measurable ROI to customers, working with technical decision-makers who understand the value of automation for their support operations.

Once teams are freed from reactive support, we want to help them tackle what\u2019s next: providing personalized concierge services to their customers.\n\nTo deliver this combination of powerful AI systems and well designed tooling we\u2019re leveraging Jamie\u2019s https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-hall-30360954/ experience as an early member of Google\u2019s generative AI team and Steve\u2019s https://www.linkedin.com/in/shind/ experience building for operational teams at Stripe, as well as the experience of our team who\u2019ve joined us from places like Stripe, Canva, Atlassian, Dropbox and Dovetail.\n\nWe are growing fast, have paying customers, real revenue, an exciting roadmap and a strong sales pipeline.
