You excel at mentoring developers with different specializations, from systems engineers to product-focused generalists, providing constructive feedback and helping individuals grow in their careers\n\n - Excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams (Product, Design, other Engineering squads) and translating complex technical details into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders\n\n - Creative and pragmatic problem-solver with a knack for navigating complex technical challenges. Able to make sound architectural decisions that balance immediate product needs (Social Affiliate) with long-term platform health and scalability (Phantom)\n\n - Demonstrated experience balancing hands-on technical involvement with high-level leadership.
