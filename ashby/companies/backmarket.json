We're a global marketplace for refurbished devices, helping lower our collective environmental impact by providing trustworthy, affordable tech with 92% less carbon emissions than new.\n\nYep, you read that right. Turns out refurbished tech is way better for the planet than new. In fact, With every device purchased on Back Market, our positive impact on the planet grows.

Our mission is simple: to do more with what we already have.\n\nAre you ready to join us?\n\nOur engineering department, the Bureau of technology\nOur technology department, known as the Bureau of Technology (BoT), is at the heart of Back Market. It consists of over 30 dynamic product teams that are engaged in developing and managing services to deliver significant value to our customers and suppliers. These teams are effectively supported by our Platform group, which includes more than 10 specialized teams addressing cross-cutting technical issues to enhance our operational capabilities. http://capabilities.in/\nIn addition to these functional teams, we have established numerous groups dedicated to sharing knowledge across various technical disciplines, such as security, backend, frontend, AI, and mobile.

This transition provides an opportunity to modernize the platform, raising engineering standards.\n\nBuilding a set of efficient and loosely coupled services is one of the main challenges to face for the years to come. But teams are excited to independently control their release schedules, manage their data, SLAs, tools, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 be responsible for their own service-offering.
