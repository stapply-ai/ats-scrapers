Vetcove's eCommerce and mobile platforms enable veterinary practices to compare and buy from all of their vendors in one place. Our community of more than 17,000 veterinary hospitals employs tens of thousands of veterinarians, and delivers care to many millions of animals every year across all 50 states. We\u2019re a growing team on a mission to modernize the $50B+ animal health industry. Simply put, Vetcove helps veterinary organizations spend more time giving care, and less time shopping and comparing across vendors to supply their practices. Vetcove is a Y Combinator and venture-backed growth stage company with notable investors in Silicon Valley and NYC. We're looking for exceptionally talented and passionate people to join our growing team.\u00a0\n\nAs Chief of Staff, you\u2019ll be the right hand to our leadership team\u2014helping navigate the complexities of a high-growth startup. In this high-impact role, you\u2019ll help drive forward our most critical priorities, work across every division of the company to streamline operations, and ensure that cross-functional initiatives move from idea to reality. This is an ideal role for someone who thrives in an ultra fast-paced, high-growth environment, enjoys solving complex problems, and is eager to make a direct impact on company trajectory.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Partner with the executive team to define and operationalize strategic objectives\n\n - Lead and oversee cross-functional initiatives to ensure timely, high-quality execution\n\n - Drive accountability by establishing clear goals, timelines, and reporting processes\n\n - Identify and resolve organizational bottlenecks and inefficiencies\n\n - Coordinate high-impact projects that span multiple teams and stakeholders\n\n - Ensure consistent, transparent communication between leadership and the broader team\n\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE LOOKING FOR\n\nWe\u2019re not hung up on titles or years of experience. What matters most is that you\u2019re sharp, driven, and able to make sense of complex problems\u2014then turn them into clear, actionable plans.\n\nYou might be a great fit if:\n\n - You\u2019ve previously served in a Chief of Staff (or senior operations) role and loved being at the center of everything\n\n - You\u2019re a systems thinker who can zoom out to see the big picture, then dive deep to get things done\n\n - You\u2019re naturally curious, proactive, and love asking \u201cwhy\u201d until things make sense\n\n - You communicate clearly\u2014whether you\u2019re drafting a strategy doc, running a meeting, or chatting one-on-one\n\n - You thrive in fast-paced, sometimes ambiguous environments and know how to bring order to chaos\n\n - You\u2019re the kind of person people instinctively trust to figure things out and follow through\n\nAn MBA or background in strategy, operations, or product is a plus\u2014but intelligence, hunger, and competence matter far more to us.\n\n\nBENEFITS (FULL TIME ROLES)\n\n - 100% remote within the USA\n\n - Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance\n\n - Automatic 401k contribution\n\n - Employee referral program\n\n - At home office set up\n\n - Bi-annual company retreats\n\n - Open vacation policy\n\n - Equity\n\n - Monthly team events\n\nThe typical base pay range for this role across the U.S. is: $80,000/year - $170,000/year + bonus + equity + benefits.

This salary range is a good faith estimate of what Vetcove may pay for this position at the time of posting. Actual compensation may vary based on skills, qualifications, and experience. The range reflects the base hourly rate or annual compensation (as applicable), and does not include bonus, equity or other incentives.\n\nIn addition to base compensation, Vetcove offers a comprehensive benefits\npackage.
