Ensure the right levels of staffing and succession planning; execute weekly on recruiting, interviewing, and hiring tactics.\n\n - Be responsible for the resilient operation of software including gathering metrics, alerting, bug count, uptime and security, but also effective on-call or incident response.\n\n - Ensure we make the best technology and process decisions. Hold teams to best-practices and standards while involving experts and encouraging proposals to improve.\n\n - Create transparency; maintain clear executive summaries for all stakeholders and representing all projects and your team status with documentation and data.\n\nCoaching, Teamwork, Performance\n\n - Utilize both management and technical skills, be ready to provide hands-on mentorship and career coaching with both managers and senior engineers.\n\n - Set and raise the bar for performance, communicate what you expect from managers and ICs. Execute continuously on performance management to make us better!\n\n - Ensure that developers work collaboratively - within teams and across teams. Provide the framework and daily participation necessary to enable smooth and constant collaboration.\n\n - Operate within our values, culture, policy, and strategies. Contextualize decisions and policies (e.g. from our People or Compliance teams) for teams to ensure we\u2019re meeting obligations.\n\nSo What Are We Looking For?\n\n - At least 5 years of leadership experience on software development teams.\n\n - At least 3 years leadership experience while managing through team leads or managers on software development teams.\n\n - Prior hands-on experience in a top technical role - such as Senior Software Developer.\n\n - Experience as a leader running (not just building) production software systems.\n\n - Background with highly regulated or complex industries (finance, health, etc) is a plus.\n\n - Appetite to lead from the front, and excitement to participate physically in-person.\n\n - Ambition to do big things, be the best, and tackle the hardest challenges.\n\n - Located in (or willing to quickly relocate to) Calgary AB.\n\nWorking at Neo:\n\nThe people who thrive at Neo are resourceful, growth-oriented, and driven to win.

If you want to own big outcomes, move fast, and redefine what \u201csupport\u201d means in financial services, you\u2019ll thrive here.\n\nWhat you'll be doing:\n\n - Design end-to-end product experiences for our support, customer wellness, and customer chat products across web and mobile, balancing usability, performance, and delight.\n\n - Collaborate with PMs, engineers, and business leaders from problem framing through execution to ensure we\u2019re solving the right problems in the best way.\n\n - Lead discovery efforts, mapping journeys, defining flows, prototyping concepts, and validating ideas through research and iteration.\n\n - Build systems, not just screens, designing for scalability, accessibility, and the real-world complexities of operational tools and customer interactions.\n\n - Shape strategy for Operations Excellence, influencing roadmap decisions with a deep understanding of customer needs and business priorities.\n\n - Work with research, analytics, and content design to uncover opportunities and create experiences that improve satisfaction and reduce support volume.\n\n - Contribute to Neo\u2019s design system, ensuring consistent, high-quality experiences across all customer touchpoints.\n\n - Advocate for the customer, using design to make support feel simple, human, and trustworthy.\n\n - Mentor and support other designers, sharing feedback, tools, and best practices.\n\nWho we are looking for:\n\n - 5+ years of product design experience, shipping real-world products across platforms.\n\n - Strong craft across interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.\n\n - Experience working cross-functionally with PMs, engineers, operations, and support teams.\n\n - A systems thinker who can connect micro-interactions to broader service and customer journeys.\n\n - Comfortable in ambiguity, you bring structure, clarity, and momentum to messy problem spaces.\n\n - Obsessed with measurable outcomes: you care as much about resolution rates, CSAT, and financial confidence as you do about pixels.\n\n - Strong communicator who can present, explain, and defend design decisions with clarity and humility.\n\n - Experience in support tools, chat platforms, or financial services is a plus, but not required, you can learn fast and think like an owner.\n\nWorking at Neo:\n\nThe people who thrive at Neo are resourceful, growth-oriented, and driven to win.
