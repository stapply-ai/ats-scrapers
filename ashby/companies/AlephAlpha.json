We do this with a flat hierarchy and IC-driven culture: ideas come from the bottom up, and it\u2019s our shared responsibility to deliver impactful research.\n\n\nTHE POSITION:\n\nWe\u2019re looking for skilled (Senior) Software Engineers to join our research team, headquartered in Heidelberg. While we highly value in-person work, we offer the flexibility to work from Berlin or elsewhere in Germany and with regular travel to onsite events.\n\nThis job posting reflects multiple openings across our research teams; during our interview process, we will align your candidacy both in terms of team/focus assignment, but also according to seniority.\n\nAs a (Senior) AI Software Engineer in Aleph Alpha Research, you help the research teams train models and iterate on cutting-edge ideas. You own significant portions of the research infrastructure, including data processing pipelines, our model lineage tooling, our testing infrastructure, our cluster management systems and engineering-heavy parts of our distributed training software.\n\nWe build and train large-scale models using Python and PyTorch. Our infrastructure runs in our own data centre on Kubernetes, managed by a dedicated team. You'll work on systems that handle petabytes of data and contribute to optimising our distributed training software to run efficiently over entire clusters. This is high-scale, high-impact engineering.\n\n\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\nYou can expect to contribute to the following areas:\n\n - Design and develop tooling to accelerate research\n\n - Collaborate with researchers to develop, train, persist and evaluate deep learning models\n\n - Deep-dive on performance-critical code to enable efficient training at scale\n\n - Improve our data ingestion and processing pipelines and help curate state-of-the-art datasets\n\n - Set up systems to ensure our codebases are maintainable\n\n - Collaborate with our Product team to bring AI research innovations into real-world applications\n\n - Contribute to papers and technical reports and help present them at top international AI conferences\n\n - Mentor engineers and researchers in your areas of software engineering expertise\n\n - Engage in our hiring process to identify talented engineers to join our team\n\n - Co-own efforts to make code, data and model artefacts available to the broader research community\n\n\nYOUR PROFILE\n\nIn Aleph Alpha Research, we hire deliberately.
