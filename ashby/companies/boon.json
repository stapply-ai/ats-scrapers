Founded in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2023 by product and engineering leaders from Samsara, Apple, Google and DoorDash. Boon is backed by leading Silicon Valley venture capitalists.\n\nOur AI agents embed directly into existing workflows, from preconstruction estimating to bid management. They automate the repetitive tasks that drain time and margins while surfacing the insights leaders need to make faster and more confident decisions.\n\nThe result is measurable impact. Teams move faster, bids are submitted sooner, win rates increase, and costs are reduced. Boon enables construction companies to build more, generate more revenue, and grow with confidence.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nAs an Applied ML Engineer focused on Computer Vision at Boon, you will build production computer vision systems that transform how construction companies process and understand visual data.
