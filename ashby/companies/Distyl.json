Our platform, Distillery, along with our team of AI Engineers, Researchers, and Strategists, is pioneering AI-native systems of work, solving the most complex, high-stakes challenges at scale.\n\nDistyl is founded and led by proven leaders from companies like Palantir, Apple, and top national laboratories. We work in deep partnership with OpenAI, jointly going-to-market at the largest enterprises and collaborating evaluating and testing the latest models. Backed by Lightspeed, Khosla, Coatue, industry leaders like Nat Friedman (former GitHub CEO), as well as board members of over 20+ F500s, Distyl is building the future of AI-powered enterprise operations.\n\n\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\nAt Distyl we\u2019re pushing the envelope of AI utilization in enterprise. This requires creative researchers who don\u2019t just want to drive incremental improvements on benchmarks or optimize an existing process but instead are looking to creatively redefine how software is used.\n\nOur researchers come from many academic backgrounds but have strong research track records, operate in an AI-native way, and would be bored staying on the rails of a traditional research org.\n\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n - The Post-Training team focuses on adapting foundation models to real-world performance and alignment requirements. Researchers develop and evaluate techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization (DPO, RLHF, RLAIF), and continual adaptation to align models with Distyl\u2019s enterprise systems. The goal is to bridge raw model capability with trustworthy, contextually aligned system behavior.\n\n - Researchers in Post-Training investigate new methods for aligning large models with human and system-level objectives. They explore trade-offs between generalization and specialization, data efficiency and robustness, capability and controllability. Their work informs how Distyl leverages foundation models safely, effectively, and at scale across industries.\n\n\nWHAT WE REQUIRE\n\n - Deep Understanding of Post-training Techniques: Familiarity with supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization (RLHF/DPO), LoRA/PEFT, and instruction-tuning pipelines.\n\n - Experience Adapting Frontier Models: You\u2019ve tuned or adapted LLMs/SLMs to specialized domains or behaviors through data curation, reward modeling, or continual pretraining.\n\n - Experience Building with Models, Not Just Building Models: We develop intelligent systems using models rather than training or fine-tuning them. Ideal candidates have expertise in compound AI systems, agentic collaboration, and associated techniques (ensembling, ReAct, graph-of-thoughts, etc.).\n\n - Proven Track Record of Research Results: Whether you\u2019ve published in top journals, posted amazing work on twitter, or somewhere else we want to see what you've done.\n\n - Uses AI Every Day: Before you can revolutionize someone else\u2019s workflow, you need to revolutionize yours. You should be using tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, and Perplexity to accelerate your workflow.\n\n - Strong Programming and Data Analysis Skills: While you might not consider yourself a software engineer you need to be able to build prototypes of your ideas and then perform the experiments to prove the effectiveness to a F500 Head of AI.\n\n - Biases Towards Showing vs Telling: Our customers want to see the power of AI today vs discuss the most elegant idea that will take 5 years to realize.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - An opportunity to advance the cutting edge of LLM research and directly revolutionize work in the enterprise space.\n\n - Ownership of high-impact research projects, with the autonomy to explore novel approaches and solutions.\n\n - Access to state-of-the-art AI models, real business problems, and proprietary data sets across a diverse range of real-world industries.\n\n - Competitive salary and benefits package, including equity options, medical/dental/vision covered at 100% for you and your dependents, 401K plan, and perks such as commuter benefits and lunch provided in office.\n\n - Be part of a mission-oriented company to create practical adoption during the biggest revolution in human productivity.\n\n - A collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment that encourages innovation and personal growth.\n\nIf you are an innovative, ambitious, and driven individual looking to make a difference in the world of AI, we want to hear from you.

Our platform, Distillery, along with our team of AI Engineers, Researchers, and Strategists, is pioneering AI-native systems of work, solving the most complex, high-stakes challenges at scale.\n\nDistyl is founded and led by proven leaders from companies like Palantir, Apple, and top national laboratories. We work in deep partnership with OpenAI, jointly going-to-market at the largest enterprises and collaborating evaluating and testing the latest models. Backed by Lightspeed, Khosla, Coatue, industry leaders like Nat Friedman (former GitHub CEO), as well as board members of over 20+ F500s, Distyl is building the future of AI-powered enterprise operations.\n\n\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\nAt Distyl we\u2019re pushing the envelope of AI utilization in enterprise. This requires creative researchers who don\u2019t just want to drive incremental improvements on benchmarks or optimize an existing process but instead are looking to creatively redefine how software is used.\n\nOur researchers come from many academic backgrounds but have strong research track records, operate in an AI-native way, and would be bored staying on the rails of a traditional research org.\n\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n - Analogous to hypothesis generation in the space of AI for scientific discovery, the System Discovery team focuses on identifying entirely new classes of AI systems. Researchers explore a wide range of architectures, modalities, and compositions to uncover how AI can most effectively reshape work.\n\n - Draw connections across disparate domains to uncover new system archetypes. Experiment with unconventional problem definitions and develop prototypes that reveal new categories of human\u2013AI collaboration.\n\n\nWHAT WE REQUIRE\n\n - Experience Building a Wide Breadth of Systems: You\u2019ve built across many paradigms\u2014retrieval pipelines, reasoning agents, evaluation harnesses, multimodal integrations, or workflow graph systems\u2014and can abstract what makes each effective.\n\n - Experience Building with Models, Not Just Building Models: We develop intelligent systems using models rather than training or fine-tuning them.
