We are living in an era of AI transition - this new project team will be focusing on building applications to enable more real world impact and highest usage for the world.\n\nThis role is a global role with hybrid work arrangement - combining flexible remote work with in-office collaboration at our HQ. You\u2019ll work closely with regional teams across product, engineering, operations, infrastructure and data to build and scale impactful AI solutions.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nYou\u2019ll fine-tune state-of-the-art models, design evaluation frameworks, and bring AI features into production. Your work ensures our models are not only intelligent, but also safe, trustworthy, and impactful at scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Fine-tune & Adapt \u2013 Train and customize diffusion models (SDXL, Flux, Stable Diffusion variants) using LoRA, DreamBooth, and other parameter-efficient methods.\n\n - Curate Datasets \u2013 Build, clean, and annotate large-scale image datasets with captioning, tagging, and NSFW filtering for safe and aligned generation.\n\n - Evaluate & Align \u2013 Develop pipelines to measure fidelity, diversity, style adherence, and safety across generated outputs.\n\n - Optimize Performance \u2013 Apply GPU memory optimization, latent diffusion tricks, and distributed training for efficient scaling.\n\n - Deploy & Monitor \u2013 Ship diffusion-powered features into production with monitoring for drift, latency, and quality.\n\n - Collaborate & Deliver \u2013 Work with product and design to integrate generative vision capabilities into user experiences.\n\n\nWHAT IS IT LIKE\n\n - Likes ownership and independence\n\n - Believe clarity comes from action - prototype, test, and iterate without waiting for perfect plans.\n\n - Stay calm and effective in startup chaos - shifting priorities and building from zero doesn\u2019t faze you.\n\n - Bias for speed - you believe it\u2019s better to deliver something valuable now than a perfect version much later.\n\n - See feedback and failure as part of growth - you\u2019re here to level up.\n\n - Possess humility, hunger, and hustle, and lift others up as you go.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - Strong experience with diffusion models and generative vision (Stable Diffusion, SDXL, Flux, etc.).\n\n - Hands-on skills with DreamBooth, LoRA/QLoRA, and fine-tuning methods.\n\n - Proficiency with PyTorch (preferred).\n\n - Experience in dataset preparation (captioning, tagging, filtering, augmentation).\n\n - Knowledge of GPU optimization, latent diffusion, and efficient training techniques.\n\n - Strong foundations in software engineering, algorithms, and clean code practices.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n - Prior work in style transfer, personalization, or multimodal generation.\n\n - Experience with safety alignment in generative vision (NSFW detection, adversarial testing).\n\n - Open-source contributions in diffusion or generative vision projects.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\n\n - Flat structure & real ownership\n\n - Full involvement in direction and consensus decision making\n\n - Flexibility in work arrangement\n\n - High-impact role with visibility across product, data, and engineering\n\n - Top-of-market compensation and performance-based bonuses\n\n - Global exposure to product development\n\n - Lots of perks - housing rental subsidies, a quality company cafeteria, and overtime meals\n\n - Health, dental & vision insurance\n\n - Global travel insurance (for you & your dependents)\n\n - Unlimited, flexible time off\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a densed, high-performance team focused on high quality work and global impact. We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.

We are living in an era of AI transition - this new project team will be focusing on building applications to enable more real world impact and highest usage for the world.\n\nThis role is a global role with hybrid work arrangement - combining flexible remote work with in-office collaboration at our HQ. You\u2019ll work closely with regional teams across product, engineering, operations, infrastructure and data to build and scale impactful AI solutions.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nYou\u2019ll fine-tune state-of-the-art models, design evaluation frameworks, and bring AI features into production. Your work ensures our models are not only intelligent, but also safe, trustworthy, and impactful at scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Fine-tune & Adapt \u2013 Train and customize diffusion models (SDXL, Flux, Stable Diffusion variants) using LoRA, DreamBooth, and other parameter-efficient methods.\n\n - Curate Datasets \u2013 Build, clean, and annotate large-scale image datasets with captioning, tagging, and NSFW filtering for safe and aligned generation.\n\n - Evaluate & Align \u2013 Develop pipelines to measure fidelity, diversity, style adherence, and safety across generated outputs.\n\n - Optimize Performance \u2013 Apply GPU memory optimization, latent diffusion tricks, and distributed training for efficient scaling.\n\n - Deploy & Monitor \u2013 Ship diffusion-powered features into production with monitoring for drift, latency, and quality.\n\n - Collaborate & Deliver \u2013 Work with product and design to integrate generative vision capabilities into user experiences.\n\n\nWHAT IS IT LIKE\n\n - Likes ownership and independence\n\n - Believe clarity comes from action - prototype, test, and iterate without waiting for perfect plans.\n\n - Stay calm and effective in startup chaos - shifting priorities and building from zero doesn\u2019t faze you.\n\n - Bias for speed - you believe it\u2019s better to deliver something valuable now than a perfect version much later.\n\n - See feedback and failure as part of growth - you\u2019re here to level up.\n\n - Possess humility, hunger, and hustle, and lift others up as you go.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - Strong experience with diffusion models and generative vision (Stable Diffusion, SDXL, Flux, etc.).\n\n - Hands-on skills with DreamBooth, LoRA/QLoRA, and fine-tuning methods.\n\n - Proficiency with PyTorch (preferred).\n\n - Experience in dataset preparation (captioning, tagging, filtering, augmentation).\n\n - Knowledge of GPU optimization, latent diffusion, and efficient training techniques.\n\n - Strong foundations in software engineering, algorithms, and clean code practices.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n - Prior work in style transfer, personalization, or multimodal generation.\n\n - Experience with safety alignment in generative vision (NSFW detection, adversarial testing).\n\n - Open-source contributions in diffusion or generative vision projects.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\n\n - Flat structure & real ownership\n\n - Full involvement in direction and consensus decision making\n\n - Flexibility in work arrangement\n\n - High-impact role with visibility across product, data, and engineering\n\n - Top-of-market compensation and performance-based bonuses\n\n - Global exposure to product development\n\n - Lots of perks - housing rental subsidies, a quality company cafeteria, and overtime meals\n\n - Health, dental & vision insurance\n\n - Global travel insurance (for you & your dependents)\n\n - Unlimited, flexible time off\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a densed, high-performance team focused on high quality work and global impact. We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.

We are living in an era of AI transition - this new project team will be focusing on building applications to enable more real world impact and highest usage for the world.\n\nThis role is a global role with hybrid work arrangement - combining flexible remote work with in-office collaboration at our HQ. You\u2019ll work closely with regional teams across product, engineering, operations, infrastructure and data to build and scale impactful AI solutions.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nYou\u2019ll fine-tune state-of-the-art models, design evaluation frameworks, and bring AI features into production. Your work ensures our models are not only intelligent, but also safe, trustworthy, and impactful at scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Fine-tune & adapt - Use LoRA/QLoRA to optimize open-source models (LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma)\n\n - Engineer prompts & curates data - Craft prompts and datasets that reflect tone, brand voice, and safety.\n\n - Evaluate models \u2013 Build metrics pipelines for perplexity, toxicity, and relevance to ensure safe and high-quality outputs.\n\n - Deploy & monitor \u2013 Scale models into production with performance optimization and monitoring for drift.\n\n - Collaborate & deliver \u2013 Partner with product, engineering, and design teams to launch user-facing AI features.\n\n\nWHAT IS IT LIKE\n\n - Likes ownership and independence\n\n - Believe clarity comes from action - prototype, test, and iterate without waiting for perfect plans.\n\n - Stay calm and effective in startup chaos - shifting priorities and building from zero doesn\u2019t faze you.\n\n - Bias for speed - you believe it\u2019s better to deliver something valuable now than a perfect version much later.\n\n - See feedback and failure as part of growth - you\u2019re here to level up.\n\n - Possess humility, hunger, and hustle, and lift others up as you go.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - Strong experience in transformers, deep learning, and fine-tuning methods (LoRA/QLoRA, SFT, distillation).\n\n - Proficiency with PyTorch (preferred) or TensorFlow.\n\n - Skilled in prompt engineering and dataset curation for alignment with tone, safety, and trust.\n\n - Familiar with evaluation metrics: perplexity, toxicity, relevance.\n\n - Strong software engineering foundations in algorithms, data structures, and clean code practices.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n - Prior work in text generation, moderation, or personalization.\n\n - Experience with RLHF or reinforcement learning in LLMs.\n\n - Contributions to open-source ML projects.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\n\n - Flat structure & real ownership\n\n - Full involvement in direction and consensus decision making\n\n - Flexibility in work arrangement\n\n - High-impact role with visibility across product, data, and engineering\n\n - Top-of-market compensation and performance-based bonuses\n\n - Global exposure to product development\n\n - Lots of perks - housing rental subsidies, a quality company cafeteria, and overtime meals\n\n - Health, dental & vision insurance\n\n - Global travel insurance (for you & your dependents)\n\n - Unlimited, flexible time off\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a densed, high-performance team focused on high quality work and global impact. We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees. Headquartered in Malaysia and operating in Thailand, Taiwan, and Japan, we help millions of users access transparent and affordable financial protection through Bjak.com http://Bjak.com.

We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.

Own cross-functional problems and fix them like the company\u2019s future depends on it - because you\u2019re personally invested in seeing it succeed.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\n - Translate the CEO\u2019s vision into clear, actionable priorities across the company\n\n - Accelerate strategic execution and ensure consistent follow-through across teams\n\n - Operate as a central hub of communication, planning, and coordination for leadership\n\n - Solve high-impact problems with a bias for speed, structure, and accountability\n\n - Help scale the company by building systems and momentum in a fast-moving environment\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL DO\n\ni) Strategic Planning and Execution\n\n - Partner with the CEO to define, track, and drive progress on strategic priorities, OKRs, and company-wide initiatives\n\n - Ensure timely execution and alignment of cross-functional projects\n\n - Identify operational gaps or inefficiencies and coordinate solutions that enable scale\n\nii) Executive Enablement\n\n - Prepare briefings, analysis, and recommendations to support decision-making at the executive level\n\n - Optimise the CEO\u2019s time by managing priorities, scheduling, and internal/external communication\n\n - Draft and refine clear, professional communication materials for internal teams, board members, and investors\n\niii) Cross-functional Leadership Support\n\n - Facilitate leadership meetings, off-sites, and decision forums - including agenda setting, documentation, and action tracking\n\n - Serve as a key liaison across departments to ensure strategic alignment and clarity\n\n - Partner closely with department heads to surface issues, unblock progress, and maintain execution momentum\n\niii) Project Ownership\n\n - Lead cross-functional, high-priority projects that do not have a natural owner\n\n - Support early-stage strategic initiatives through planning, coordination, and execution\n\n - Build and implement systems and processes that introduce structure without slowing down the pace\n\n\nYOU WILL THRIVE HERE IF YOU...\n\n - Treat the company\u2019s success as your own, with a deep sense of responsibility and care\n\n - Thrive in high-speed, ambiguous environments with evolving priorities.\n\n - Take pride in driving outcomes - not just completing tasks.\n\n - Work with intensity, integrity, and zero ego. You care about the best outcome, not whose idea it is.\n\n - Operate with a founder mindset: proactive, resourceful, and focused on what truly moves the needle.\n\n - Communicate clearly and concisely, especially under pressure.\n\n - Stay composed in chaos, solve problems independently, and get things done without needing a playbook.\n\n - Are willing to work beyond typical hours when the mission demands it.\n\n\nWHAT YOU BRING\n\n - 5+ years of experience in consulting, strategy, business operations, or high-growth startups.\n\n - Proven ability to manage complex, cross-functional projects with minimal direction.\n\n - Strong critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.\n\n - Experience working directly with C-level executives and handling high-stakes work.\n\n - Maturity, discretion, and sound judgment - especially when navigating sensitive or high-pressure situations.\n\n - Bonus: Background in fintech, digital platforms, or founder-led companies.\n\n - Based in Malaysia and able to work from our HQ in Petaling Jaya as needed.\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a lean, high-performance team that moves fast and holds a high bar. Titles don\u2019t matter here - output, integrity, and ownership do. Everyone is expected to roll up their sleeves, contribute meaningfully, and take initiative.\n\nWe reward people who think like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, this is your kind of environment.\n\n\nWHY JOIN US\n\n - Above-market compensation for top-tier performance\n\n - A high-trust role with direct access to executive decision-making and company strategy\n\n - The opportunity to lead and shape cross-functional initiatives with real impact\n\n - Career growth into senior leadership roles (e.g., GM, COO, or operational leadership)\n\n - A mission-driven team that values clarity, speed, and ownership\n\n - A flat, no-politics culture with a bias for action and accountability\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s largest digital insurance platform.

We are living in an era of AI transition - this new project team will be focusing on building applications to enable more real world impact and highest usage for the world.\n\nThis role is a global role with hybrid work arrangement - combining flexible remote work with in-office collaboration at our HQ. You\u2019ll work closely with regional teams across product, engineering, operations, infrastructure and data to build and scale impactful AI solutions.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nYou\u2019ll fine-tune state-of-the-art models, design evaluation frameworks, and bring AI features into production. Your work ensures our models are not only intelligent, but also safe, trustworthy, and impactful at scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Run and manage open-source models efficiently, optimizing for cost and reliability\n\n - Ensure high performance and stability across GPU, CPU, and memory resources\n\n - Monitor and troubleshoot model inference to maintain low latency and high throughput\n\n - Collaborate with engineers to implement scalable and reliable model serving solutions\n\n\nWHAT IS IT LIKE\n\n - Likes ownership and independence\n\n - Believe clarity comes from action - prototype, test, and iterate without waiting for perfect plans.\n\n - Stay calm and effective in startup chaos - shifting priorities and building from zero doesn\u2019t faze you.\n\n - Bias for speed - you believe it\u2019s better to deliver something valuable now than a perfect version much later.\n\n - See feedback and failure as part of growth - you\u2019re here to level up.\n\n - Possess humility, hunger, and hustle, and lift others up as you go.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - Experience with model serving platforms such as vLLM or HuggingFace TGI\n\n - Proficiency in GPU orchestration using tools like Kubernetes, Ray, Modal, RunPod, LambdaLabs\n\n - Ability to monitor latency, costs, and scale systems efficiently with traffic demands\n\n - Experience setting up inference endpoints for backend engineers\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\n\n - Flat structure & real ownership\n\n - Full involvement in direction and consensus decision making\n\n - Flexibility in work arrangement\n\n - High-impact role with visibility across product, data, and engineering\n\n - Top-of-market compensation and performance-based bonuses\n\n - Global exposure to product development\n\n - Lots of perks - housing rental subsidies, a quality company cafeteria, and overtime meals\n\n - Health, dental & vision insurance\n\n - Global travel insurance (for you & your dependents)\n\n - Unlimited, flexible time off\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a densed, high-performance team focused on high quality work and global impact. We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.

We are living in an era of AI transition - this new project team will be focusing on building applications to enable more real world impact and highest usage for the world.\n\nThis role is a global role with hybrid work arrangement - combining flexible remote work with in-office collaboration at our HQ. You\u2019ll work closely with regional teams across product, engineering, operations, infrastructure and data to build and scale impactful AI solutions.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nYou\u2019ll fine-tune state-of-the-art models, design evaluation frameworks, and bring AI features into production. Your work ensures our models are not only intelligent, but also safe, trustworthy, and impactful at scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\n - Fine-tune & Adapt \u2013 Train and customize diffusion models (SDXL, Flux, Stable Diffusion variants) using LoRA, DreamBooth, and other parameter-efficient methods.\n\n - Curate Datasets \u2013 Build, clean, and annotate large-scale image datasets with captioning, tagging, and NSFW filtering for safe and aligned generation.\n\n - Evaluate & Align \u2013 Develop pipelines to measure fidelity, diversity, style adherence, and safety across generated outputs.\n\n - Optimize Performance \u2013 Apply GPU memory optimization, latent diffusion tricks, and distributed training for efficient scaling.\n\n - Deploy & Monitor \u2013 Ship diffusion-powered features into production with monitoring for drift, latency, and quality.\n\n - Collaborate & Deliver \u2013 Work with product and design to integrate generative vision capabilities into user experiences.\n\n\nWHAT IS IT LIKE\n\n - Likes ownership and independence\n\n - Believe clarity comes from action - prototype, test, and iterate without waiting for perfect plans.\n\n - Stay calm and effective in startup chaos - shifting priorities and building from zero doesn\u2019t faze you.\n\n - Bias for speed - you believe it\u2019s better to deliver something valuable now than a perfect version much later.\n\n - See feedback and failure as part of growth - you\u2019re here to level up.\n\n - Possess humility, hunger, and hustle, and lift others up as you go.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - Strong experience with diffusion models and generative vision (Stable Diffusion, SDXL, Flux, etc.).\n\n - Hands-on skills with DreamBooth, LoRA/QLoRA, and fine-tuning methods.\n\n - Proficiency with PyTorch (preferred).\n\n - Experience in dataset preparation (captioning, tagging, filtering, augmentation).\n\n - Knowledge of GPU optimization, latent diffusion, and efficient training techniques.\n\n - Strong foundations in software engineering, algorithms, and clean code practices.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n\n - Prior work in style transfer, personalization, or multimodal generation.\n\n - Experience with safety alignment in generative vision (NSFW detection, adversarial testing).\n\n - Open-source contributions in diffusion or generative vision projects.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET\n\n - Flat structure & real ownership\n\n - Full involvement in direction and consensus decision making\n\n - Flexibility in work arrangement\n\n - High-impact role with visibility across product, data, and engineering\n\n - Top-of-market compensation and performance-based bonuses\n\n - Global exposure to product development\n\n - Lots of perks - housing rental subsidies, a quality company cafeteria, and overtime meals\n\n - Health, dental & vision insurance\n\n - Global travel insurance (for you & your dependents)\n\n - Unlimited, flexible time off\n\n\nOUR TEAM & CULTURE\n\nWe\u2019re a densed, high-performance team focused on high quality work and global impact. We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.

We behave like owners. We value speed, clarity, and relentless ownership. If you\u2019re hungry to grow and care deeply about excellence, join us.\n\n\nABOUT BJAK\n\nBJAK is Southeast Asia\u2019s #1 insurance aggregator with 8M+ users, fully owned by its employees.
