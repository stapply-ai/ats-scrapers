Forget MQLs\u2014we\u2019re here to drive pipeline, fuel SQLs, and scale brands that are serious about growth. From Paid Media and SEO to CRO, RevOps, and Go-To-Market Strategy, we build marketing engines that win in SaaS and across B2B industries.\n\nWe move fast. We think boldly. We are elite. We hire people who challenge the status quo and push campaigns past what\u2019s expected - sparking demand for bold, innovative brands. If you live for performance, love solving hard problems, and want your work to actually mean something, you\u2019ll fit right in.\n\nBut here\u2019s the fun part\u2014we don\u2019t just deliver results; we\u2019re shaping the future of marketing. Ready to build something that breaks the mold?\n\nThe Head of Finance and Accounting is responsible for ensuring overall financial health of the business - past, present, and future. Past - ensuring historicals are accurate and taxes and notices for prior periods are followed up with for legal requirements.

We are weaker at looking forward and developing strategy\n\n - Weaker function in the leadership team and not a strong voice with department heads so budgets can seem fake and leakage/under-performance can occur.\n\n - Cost centric and value weak. No direct understanding how cutting growth budget effects EBITDA, for example. I also would like to better understand how our cost per pitch effects budget for EBITDA and payback period.\n\n - Taxes. With strong EBITDA, we need better tax planning. We are weak here.\n\n - AP/AR/Budgeting are all weaker.\n\n - Investing. How do we have 20% EBITDA and 40% YoY growth? Need to be wise + iterative into our investments and need real approach + hypothesis to spur revenue growth without cash absorption.\n\n - Debt partners. We currently have small SBA loan, but understanding how to get access to capital without dilution is valuable for ourselves and potential M&A opps that may arise.\n\n - Making us investment ready. We are going to market in the next 36 months and need the right financial leadership in place.\n\nRole and Responsibilities:\n\n 1. Accounting: Holding team accountable for various initiatives such as 5 day close, various standardized reports, and work closely with external CPA firm to ensure tax and legal requirements are adhered to within budget\n\n 2.

Approve offers, raises, and promotions and make sure they follow our guidelines\n    \n    2. Hold department leaders accountable to margin expectations in their P&L in order to grow cash\n\n 3. Treasury: Cash is the most important number for Directive. Need to ensure it is managed at safe levels and continues to grow\n    \n    1. Properly monitor AR/AP process to keep overdue receivables down and escalate when necessary\n\n 4. Risk: Work with insurance brokers and make sure all requirements are met and any inquiries are followed up within a timely manner\n\n 5. Legal: Work with legal firm to make sure all requirements are met and any inquires are followed up within a timely manner\n\n 6. Corporate Development: Support More Good Capital. on a need basis and provide strong financial modeling and due diligence so smart investments are made\n\n 7.
