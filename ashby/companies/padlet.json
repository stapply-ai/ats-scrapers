It's 2000 years old and brings spiritual fulfillment to over 2 billion people worldwide. But it wasn't Jesus who took Christianity to the masses. It took someone like St Paul to make it a thing. His thirteen letters (tailored, by the way, to each recipient) were instrumental in forming the Christian identity and early Christian communities.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Moral of this (slightly irreverent) story? Marketing is important, no matter how good a product is. People don't just see a product and magically know how to use it to make their life better.

A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.\n\nWe can all agree that Christianity is a great product. It's 2000 years old and brings spiritual fulfillment to over 2 billion people worldwide. But it wasn't Jesus who took Christianity to the masses. It took someone like St Paul to make it a thing. His thirteen letters (tailored, by the way, to each recipient) were instrumental in forming the Christian identity and early Christian communities.\n\nMoral of this (slightly irreverent) story? Marketing is important, no matter how good a product is. People don't just see a product and magically know how to use it to make their life better. Someone needs to teach them.\n\nWe are looking for an exceptional marketer to spread the gospel of Padlet.

A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.\n\nFor a majority of the world, the mobile device is their first computer. For many it\u2019s their only computer. We are looking for Mobile Engineers to improve our mobile apps so we can improve the lives of a billion people.\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n - Building new features for our iOS and/or Android apps. E.g. a voice recorder with audio effects.\n\n - Making apps faster and more reliable. E.g. making network calls more resistant to spotty internet connections.\n\n - Improving how we work. E.g. improving our internationalization pipelines we use to translate our app into 40+ languages.\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n - At some point in your life, someone has told you: \u201cyou write good code.\u201d\n\n - You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow.\n\n - Bonus: you have a good sense of humor.\n\n\nABOUT PADLET\n\n - Vision:\u00a0Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.\n\n - Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People\u00a0love\u00a0the product.\n\n - Impact: We have 40 million users, making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet.\n\n - Money: We are venture backed AND fiscally responsible. We are built to last one hundred years.\n\n - Badassery: We are only 60 odd people. That's over half a million active users per person.\n\n\nTECH STACK\n\n - Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)\n\n - Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python.\n\n - Web: VueJS, Tailwind.\n\n - Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake.\n\n\nJOYS OF PROGRAMMING AT PADLET\n\n - We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.\n\n - A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting concurrency problems.\n\n - Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.\n\n - We process a lot of data real fast. We have to solve interesting scale problems.\n\n - We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.\n\n - We ship often.\n\n - We value beautiful code.\n\n\nSORROWS OF PROGRAMMING AT PADLET\n\n - We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We\u2019re working on it!\n\n - Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We\u2019re working on it!\n\n\nSOME PEOPLE YOU\u2018D BE WORKING WITH\n\n - Linh Nguyen: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. Kind of like an electron. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Manager of people, code, and scope creep.\n\n - Colin Teahan: Lives for one-liners. E.g:\u00a0Colleague: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?\u201d\u00a0Teahan:\u00a0\u201cIt would be IRONIC.\u201d\u00a0Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps.\n\n\nTHE OFFICE\n\n - Our office https://padlet.link/sf-office-gmap is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We\u2019re a 5 minute walk from the beach. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n - The office itself is designed to be a space for all your interests and hobbies. We have a meditation room, game room, library, art studio, kids room, and full makerspace with 3d printers, presses, laser cutters, sewing machines, and more.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Top tier medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family, including One Medical memberships.\n\n - 401(k) with matching.\n\n - Commuter benefits.\n\n - FSA.\n\n - Stock options.\n\n - Catered lunches and dinners. Military grade snacking.\n\n - 20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens.\n\n - Parental leave\n\n - All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year.\n\n\nSPECIAL TIME TO JOIN\n\nBecause we're small, there's a lot of energy.

It's 2000 years old and brings spiritual fulfillment to over 2 billion people worldwide. But it wasn't Jesus who took Christianity to the masses. It took someone like St Paul to make it a thing. His thirteen letters (tailored, by the way, to each recipient) were instrumental in forming the Christian identity and early Christian communities.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Moral of this (slightly irreverent) story?

That's over half a million active users per person.\n\n\nTECH STACK\n\n - Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)\n\n - Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python.\n\n - Web: VueJS, Tailwind.\n\n - Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake.\n\n\nJOYS OF PROGRAMMING AT PADLET\n\n - We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.\n\n - A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting concurrency problems.\n\n - Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems.\n\n - We process a lot of data real fast. We have to solve interesting scale problems.\n\n - We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them.\n\n - We ship often.\n\n - We value beautiful code.\n\n\nSORROWS OF PROGRAMMING AT PADLET\n\n - We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We\u2019re working on it!\n\n - Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We\u2019re working on it!\n\n\nSOME PEOPLE YOU\u2018D BE WORKING WITH\n\n - Brian Koh: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor.\n\n - Chee Kit Chong: Chee Kit is responsible for at least 10% of Japan's GDP. He's there like every other week. Soon, they'd have to start reclaiming land so he has new things to see. Mobile engineer extraordinaire.\n\n\nTHE OFFICE\n\n - We have a\u00a0beautiful office https://padlet.link/sg-office-gmap\u00a0in the historic Bukit Pasoh Neighbourhood.\n\n - 1 minute walk from Outram Park MRT.\n\n - We have a lovely balcony.
