For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others.\n\nIn short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care and safeguard patient privacy at the same time.

But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant.\n\nWe provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant.
