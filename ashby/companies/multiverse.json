You will be expected to attend these meetings remotely.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Workload</strong>: Each Board of Examiners meeting will cover multiple modules and cohorts.

With a post-money valuation of $1.7bn, the round makes us the UK\u2019s first EdTech unicorn.\n\nBut we aren\u2019t stopping there. With a strong operational footprint and 800+ employees, we have ambitious plans to continue scaling. We\u2019re building a world where tech skills unlock people\u2019s potential and output.\n\nJoin Multiverse and power our mission to equip the workforce to win in the AI era.\n\nRole Overview\n\nWe are seeking to appoint an External Examiner to oversee the provision of our higher education accredited programs, which specialise in Data Analytics, Technology Consulting, and Software Engineering. Apprentices completing our degree programmes get awarded with a degree in BSc Digital Technology and Solutions.\n\nThe External Examiner will perform a dual function: confirming academic standards for the degree qualification and providing External Quality Assurance for the End-Point Assessment (EPA). Your role will be to ensure that national higher education standards have been achieved and upheld by Multiverse.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nAs an External Examiner for the degree and an External Assessor for the End-Point Assessment (EPA), you will hold a crucial dual role. You are responsible for confirming that the academic standards of the overall award meet sector-recognised standards, while also ensuring the quality and integrity of the EPA. You will provide an informed, independent view on how Multiverse\u2019s standards compare with similar awards and assessments at other providers based on your wealth of professional experience.\n\nYour duties will include:\n\nPre-Assessment Duties\n\n - Assessment Design and Approval: You will review, provide expert feedback on, and formally approve the design of our summative assessments before they are issued to apprentices. This includes:\n   \n   - Scrutinising assignment briefs and examination papers for the degree qualification.\n   \n   - Reviewing the assessment instruments and materials for the End-Point Assessment (EPA).\n\nPost-Assessment Duties\n\n - External Moderation: You will externally moderate apprentice results by reviewing a sample of completed, marked and internally moderated assessments. The purpose is to confirm that marking criteria have been applied fairly, accurately, and consistently.\n\n - Observation of Live Assessment (EPA): For the EPA, you will also observe live assessments (e.g., presentations, practical tasks) to ensure assessors are upholding national standards in practice.\n\nOverarching Responsibilities\n\n - External Quality Assurance for EPA: You will review EPA documentation and materials, and attend EPA Standardisation Meetings to ensure assessors are applying assessment criteria correctly and upholding national standards.\n\n - Board of Examiners: You will attend and contribute to relevant Board of Examiners meetings in which decisions are being made about granting credits, approving progressions and awards. You will typically attend eight Board of Examiners meetings a year.\n\n - Reporting: You will be prompted to submit an Annual Report on apprentice performance and academic standards, as well as on the effectiveness of our assessments. This report will include any lessons to be drawn and actions to be taken. You will also report confidentially to the Director of Advanced Programmes on any matters of serious concern.\n\n - Stakeholder Engagement: You will conduct at least one visit per cohort (virtual or in-person) to engage with assessors, staff, apprentices, and employers to gain a holistic view of assessment quality.\n\nCadence and Logistics\n\n - Boards of Examiners: Multiverse operates on a quarterly enrollment schedule, which means we have eight Boards of Examiners per year. There will be two per quarter: one to confirm credits for general modules and progress learners from one level to the next, and one to gateway and/or award apprentices. You will be expected to attend these meetings remotely.\n\n - Workload: Each Board of Examiners meeting will cover multiple modules and cohorts. An additional External Examiner will be appointed once you reach 10 modules or 200 scripts to moderate, whichever threshold is met first.\n\nProgramme Specific Information:\n\nExternal Examiners are required for our degree programmes, resulting in a BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional (Digital Transformation), BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional (Data Analyst), and BSc Hons Digital and Technology Solutions (Software Engineering). These are apprenticeship programmes with all participating apprentices in full-time roles. Multiverse\u2019s approach to blended work-based learning ensures consistent and deliberate alignment between the knowledge learners are acquiring and the skills they are practising on a day-to-day basis in their role.\n\nProgramme summary:\n\n - Stage 1 (Level 5): Foundational and Advanced Application: This stage begins by establishing the fundamentals of the DTSP standard, developing learners into junior professionals. It then broadens their technical knowledge by introducing more complex skills and practices. Learners will synthesise concepts, evaluate how they inform day-to-day work, and apply their learning to solve increasingly complex problems.\n\n - Stage 2 (Level 6): Professional Mastery and Specialisation: In the final stage, learners deepen the expertise acquired at Level 5 to independently and confidently apply their knowledge across a range of situations. The programme culminates in a final, large-scale digital transformation project that will showcase their comprehensive learning and skills from across the entire programme.\n\nA more in-depth programme specification will be provided to successful applicants.\n\nCompensation\n\nYour compensation will be provided on a per-task basis:\n\n - Induction: \u00a3200\n\n - Board of Examiners: \u00a3250 (up to 100 scripts moderated)\n\n - EPA Standardisation Meetings: \u00a3250\n\n - Additional Scripts: \u00a375 for each additional script up to 50 scripts moderated\n\n - Assessment Approval: \u00a3125 per approval of assessment\n\n - Annual Report: \u00a3200\n\nKey Skills and Characteristics\n\nWe are looking for someone with:\n\n - Significant academic experience in Higher Education.\n\n - Previous External Examiner experience.\n\n - Program-specific subject matter expertise.\n\n - A preferred understanding of apprenticeships.\n\n - A passion for applied learning.\n\n - A flexible disposition, comfortable with non-traditional processes.\n\n - A high degree of knowledge and good understanding of the UK Higher Education sector and appropriate sector reference points;\n\n - An understanding of academic standards and quality assurance processes in higher education institutions.\n\n - Understanding of the principles of applied learning in higher education;\n\n - Experience of course design and assessment at the level we are seeking;\n\n - Experience of assessment procedures, particularly innovative forms of assessment which are focused on applied learning;\n\n - Understanding of the specific programme provision and how it is different from other forms of higher education\n\n - Standing, credibility and breadth of experience within the subject area\n\nApplication Process\n\nTo apply, please submit a Cover Letter and CV.\n\nThis should include the following information:\n\n - Academic Qualifications;\n\n - Any professional body membership;\n\n - Teaching experience;\n\n - Curriculum development;\n\n - Prior experience as External Examiner;\n\n - Academic Publications.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "31c4a72c-3598-4dce-8908-da3f8e5ed652", "title": "Mid Market Account Executive, UK", "department": "Sales", "team": "Mid Market Sales", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "London", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2023-10-20T15:07:03.652+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "England", "addressCountry": "UK", "addressLocality": "London"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/multiverse/31c4a72c-3598-4dce-8908-da3f8e5ed652", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/multiverse/31c4a72c-3598-4dce-8908-da3f8e5ed652/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Multiverse is the upskilling platform for AI and Tech adoption.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have partnered with 1,500+ companies to deliver a new kind of learning that's transforming today\u2019s workforce.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our upskilling apprenticeships are designed for people of any age and career stage to build critical AI, data, and tech skills.

In parallel, we can see clear demand from our customers and partners for a non-apprenticeship product, which drives AI tool adoption.

Using a mix of software and services, it delivers personalised, role and tool-specific AI use cases and upskilling at scale. Social features, along with measured and reported RO,I further drive adoption and business impact.\n\nWe\u2019re now looking to develop and scale this product at pace, with the VP AI Adoption Product hiring a dedicated team of engineers, engagement managers and more to expedite its roll out. You'll establish our Adoption Platform as its own \u2018start-up\u2019 within the business, with the benefit of our existing customer base, IP and established team to support its growth.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\n1. Product Strategy and Vision: Define the platform's long-term vision, strategy, and roadmap, continually iterating on it to find established product market fit.\n\n2. Product Development and Launch: end-to-end ownership of the product lifecycle from concept to launch and iteration, creating a product that delights customers and delivers measured business impact.\n\n3. Customer / Partner Centricity and Engagement: Build relationships with customers and partners to maintain focus on their needs for continuous product evolution, including implementing development partner programmes.\n\n4. Team Recruitment and Leadership: Recruit, develop and scale a dedicated cross-functional team, fostering an agile, results-driven environment and collaboration with existing Multiverse teams.\n\n5. Scale to Deliver Sustainable Business Results: Expand to new customers and markets, maturing the product to deliver scaled customer adoption and business impact. Own the product\u2019s P&L, including revenue and margin goals.\n\nAbout you\n\n\nREQUIRED EXPERIENCE\n\n - Proven track record launching new products or entering new markets\n\n - Deep experience in developing products with technical teams\n\n - Deep experience in B2B sales to C-Suite decision makers\n\n - Strong understanding of AI/ML landscape and enterprise adoption challenges\n\n - Experience in hiring and scaling product and commercial teams\n\n\nPREFERRED EXPERIENCE\n\n - Background in workforce transformation or workforce technology\n\n - Experience with ISV partnership ecosystems\n\n\nSKILLS & ATTRIBUTES\n\n - Strategic Vision: Ability to see around corners and build long-term competitive advantage\n\n - Execution Excellence: Track record of delivering results in fast-moving environments\n\n - Customer Obsession: Deep empathy for customer challenges and outcomes\n\n - Data-Driven: Comfortable with metrics, analytics, and ROI-focused selling\n\n - Collaborative Leadership: Experience working across global, cross-functional teams\n\n - Market Intelligence: Deep network within UK enterprise technology ecosystem\n\nBenefits\n\n - Time off - 27 days holiday, plus 5 additional days off: 1 life event day, 2 volunteer days, 2 company-wide wellbeing days (M-Powered Weekend) and 8 bank holidays per year\n\n - Health & Wellness- private medical Insurance with Bupa, a medical cashback scheme, life insurance, gym membership & wellness resources through Wellhub and access to Spill - all in one mental health support\n\n - Hybrid work offering - we collaborate in the office 3 days per week\n\n - Work-from-anywhere scheme - you'll have the opportunity to work from anywhere, up to 10 days per year\n\n - Team fun - weekly socials, company wide events and office snacks!\n\nOur commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nWe\u2019re an equal opportunities employer.
