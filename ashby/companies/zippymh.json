We believe modern manufactured homes are affordable, well-built, eco-friendly, and stylish, but finding a lender who understands this market can be challenging. That\u2019s why Zippy focuses exclusively on manufactured home loans, offering a seamless, digital experience.\n\nHeadquartered in Dallas, TX, with an office in Tempe, AZ, Zippy provides home loans and insurance to manufactured home buyers throughout the United States. Our remote-first team is spread across cities like Dallas, Houston, Knoxville, Omaha, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and several other states and cities. Backed by institutional investors, we offer competitive pay, stock options, and excellent benefits. At Zippy, we pride ourselves on our commitment to finance happiness through the power of home. We are dedicated to enhancing consumers' financial outcomes and tackling the affordable housing crisis through cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions.\n\nAs Zippy\u2019s Borrower Success Manager, you\u2019ll lead a borrower-facing team responsible for driving loan progress from qualification through approval. Your team of Zippy Guide Associates serves as the primary point of contact for borrowers, community partners, and soon dealer partners - ensuring conditions are satisfied quickly, documentation is complete, and every borrower feels supported from start to finish.\n\nThis is a dynamic high-impact leadership role blending people development, operational execution, and performance management. You\u2019ll coach and motivate your team to improve borrower engagement, accelerate document collection, and increase conversion - all while upholding compliance and a consistent borrower experience. Your focus will be on effectiveness: how well the team is driving the pipeline forward, resolving blockers, and achieving measurable results.\n\nNote: This team does not handle loan processing directly - their focus is on proactive borrower outreach and condition/document collection that keeps loans moving toward funding.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nTeam Leadership & Coaching\n\n - Lead, mentor, and motivate a high-performing team of Zippy Guide Associates through structured coaching, training, and daily engagement.\n\n - Maintain a daily coaching rhythm - including call listening, live feedback, and motivational team huddles to reinforce best practices and drive performance.\n\n - Listen to calls, review borrower interactions, and provide actionable feedback to improve connection, clarity, and borrower engagement.\n\n - Lead by example - when the team hits challenges, you\u2019re comfortable picking up the phone, handling a borrower conversation, and modeling how it\u2019s done the Zippy way.\n\n - Inspire a performance culture rooted in accountability, responsiveness, and borrower success.\n\n - Drive consistency in communication quality, borrower follow-through, and use of systems and tools.\n\nPipeline & Production Management\n\n - Own the borrower-side pipeline from qualification to approval, ensuring efficiency and velocity in document and condition collection.\n\n - Track daily and weekly metrics for contact rates, condition turnaround times, and conversion performance.\n\n - Identify bottlenecks and intervene early to keep loans moving through the funnel.\n\n - Partner closely with Sales, Underwriting, and Community/Dealer teams to align on production goals and maintain balanced pipeline loading across team members.\n\nCondition Fulfillment & Borrower Engagement\n\n - Ensure your team executes proactive outreach (calls, texts, emails) to obtain borrower documents and resolve outstanding conditions.\n\n - Monitor and drive turnaround speed - how fast the team can get required items in the door - while maintaining accuracy and borrower satisfaction.\n\n - Equip the team to handle objections, clarify next steps, and keep borrowers motivated to complete their loan journey.\n\n - Serve as the escalation manager for borrower or partner challenges requiring immediate resolution, ensuring issues are addressed quickly and effectively.\n\nContact Center Operations\n\n - Oversee daily call center operations - managing inbound and outbound outreach volumes, queue handling, and productivity.\n\n - Monitor and optimize staffing, pipeline load, and scheduling to ensure balanced coverage and maximum output.\n\n - Leverage call data, performance dashboards, and listening sessions to identify trends and coaching opportunities.\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally to evaluate and implement tools (e.g., dialers, CRM workflows) that improve efficiency and borrower experience.\n\nCross-Functional Partnership & Process Improvement\n\n - Partner with Product, Sales, Learning & Development, and Operations to continuously refine borrower-facing systems, messaging, and training.\n\n - Provide field insights and feedback to help design better workflows and tools for condition management and borrower outreach.\n\n - You\u2019re naturally curious about tools and systems - if something\u2019s slowing the team down, you\u2019re the first to flag it and partner with Product or L&D to fix it.\n\n - Identify opportunities to improve communication flows, borrower education, and team efficiency.\n\nQuality Control Preparation\n\n - Prepare loan files for internal or external quality control audits.\n\n - Correct or flag any quality issues proactively before the file reaches underwriting or closing.\n\n - Ensure proper documentation and explanations for any discrepancies or red flags.\n\nCompliance & Leadership\n\n - Reinforce adherence to lending regulations, internal policies, and NMLS requirements.\n\n - Lead both licensed and unlicensed team members with integrity and ethical standards that align with Zippy\u2019s values.\n\n - Teach and reinforce Zippy\u2019s borrower-first, ethical approach to lending and sales.\n\n - Ensure accuracy and quality in all borrower interactions and documentation efforts.\n\nQualifications\n\n - 5+ years of experience in mortgage or consumer lending with strong familiarity in borrower engagement, document collection, and condition management.\n\n - 2+ years managing a call center or borrower success team in a high-performance environment.\n\n - Demonstrated ability to motivate teams, drive results, and meet or exceed production goals.\n\n - Deep understanding of pipeline management, borrower communication, and operational execution within regulated environments.\n\n - Highly organized, data-minded, and skilled at identifying workflow inefficiencies.\n\n - Excellent communicator with a clear, confident, and empathetic leadership style.\n\n - NMLS licensed or willing to obtain licensing within 60 days of hire.\n\n - Experience with manufactured housing or chattel loans is a strong plus.\n\n - Preferred location: Dallas, Phoenix, or San Antonio.\n\n - Fluent in Spanish.\n\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\nYou thrive in fast-paced, results-oriented environments where success is measured by impact and momentum. You\u2019re a natural motivator who blends operational rigor with people-first leadership - just as comfortable jumping on the phones as you are strategizing at a high level.

We believe modern manufactured homes are affordable, well-built, eco-friendly, and stylish, but finding a lender who understands this market can be challenging. That\u2019s why Zippy focuses exclusively on manufactured home loans, offering a seamless, digital experience.\n\nHeadquartered in Dallas, TX, with an office in Tempe, AZ, Zippy provides home loans and insurance to manufactured home buyers throughout the United States. Our remote-first team is spread across cities like Dallas, Houston, Knoxville, Omaha, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and several other states and cities. Backed by institutional investors, we offer competitive pay, stock options, and excellent benefits. At Zippy, we pride ourselves on our commitment to finance happiness through the power of home. We are dedicated to enhancing consumers' financial outcomes and tackling the affordable housing crisis through cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions.\n\nAs Zippy\u2019s Borrower Success Manager, you\u2019ll lead a borrower-facing team responsible for driving loan progress from qualification through approval. Your team of Zippy Guide Associates serves as the primary point of contact for borrowers, community partners, and soon dealer partners - ensuring conditions are satisfied quickly, documentation is complete, and every borrower feels supported from start to finish.\n\nThis is a dynamic high-impact leadership role blending people development, operational execution, and performance management. You\u2019ll coach and motivate your team to improve borrower engagement, accelerate document collection, and increase conversion - all while upholding compliance and a consistent borrower experience. Your focus will be on effectiveness: how well the team is driving the pipeline forward, resolving blockers, and achieving measurable results.\n\nNote: This team does not handle loan processing directly - their focus is on proactive borrower outreach and condition/document collection that keeps loans moving toward funding.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nTeam Leadership & Coaching\n\n - Lead, mentor, and motivate a high-performing team of Zippy Guide Associates through structured coaching, training, and daily engagement.\n\n - Maintain a daily coaching rhythm - including call listening, live feedback, and motivational team huddles to reinforce best practices and drive performance.\n\n - Listen to calls, review borrower interactions, and provide actionable feedback to improve connection, clarity, and borrower engagement.\n\n - Lead by example - when the team hits challenges, you\u2019re comfortable picking up the phone, handling a borrower conversation, and modeling how it\u2019s done the Zippy way.\n\n - Inspire a performance culture rooted in accountability, responsiveness, and borrower success.\n\n - Drive consistency in communication quality, borrower follow-through, and use of systems and tools.\n\nPipeline & Production Management\n\n - Own the borrower-side pipeline from qualification to approval, ensuring efficiency and velocity in document and condition collection.\n\n - Track daily and weekly metrics for contact rates, condition turnaround times, and conversion performance.\n\n - Identify bottlenecks and intervene early to keep loans moving through the funnel.\n\n - Partner closely with Sales, Underwriting, and Community/Dealer teams to align on production goals and maintain balanced pipeline loading across team members.\n\nCondition Fulfillment & Borrower Engagement\n\n - Ensure your team executes proactive outreach (calls, texts, emails) to obtain borrower documents and resolve outstanding conditions.\n\n - Monitor and drive turnaround speed - how fast the team can get required items in the door - while maintaining accuracy and borrower satisfaction.\n\n - Equip the team to handle objections, clarify next steps, and keep borrowers motivated to complete their loan journey.\n\n - Serve as the escalation manager for borrower or partner challenges requiring immediate resolution, ensuring issues are addressed quickly and effectively.\n\nContact Center Operations\n\n - Oversee daily call center operations - managing inbound and outbound outreach volumes, queue handling, and productivity.\n\n - Monitor and optimize staffing, pipeline load, and scheduling to ensure balanced coverage and maximum output.\n\n - Leverage call data, performance dashboards, and listening sessions to identify trends and coaching opportunities.\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally to evaluate and implement tools (e.g., dialers, CRM workflows) that improve efficiency and borrower experience.\n\nCross-Functional Partnership & Process Improvement\n\n - Partner with Product, Sales, Learning & Development, and Operations to continuously refine borrower-facing systems, messaging, and training.\n\n - Provide field insights and feedback to help design better workflows and tools for condition management and borrower outreach.\n\n - You\u2019re naturally curious about tools and systems - if something\u2019s slowing the team down, you\u2019re the first to flag it and partner with Product or L&D to fix it.\n\n - Identify opportunities to improve communication flows, borrower education, and team efficiency.\n\nQuality Control Preparation\n\n - Prepare loan files for internal or external quality control audits.\n\n - Correct or flag any quality issues proactively before the file reaches underwriting or closing.\n\n - Ensure proper documentation and explanations for any discrepancies or red flags.\n\nCompliance & Leadership\n\n - Reinforce adherence to lending regulations, internal policies, and NMLS requirements.\n\n - Lead both licensed and unlicensed team members with integrity and ethical standards that align with Zippy\u2019s values.\n\n - Teach and reinforce Zippy\u2019s borrower-first, ethical approach to lending and sales.\n\n - Ensure accuracy and quality in all borrower interactions and documentation efforts.\n\nQualifications\n\n - 5+ years of experience in mortgage or consumer lending with strong familiarity in borrower engagement, document collection, and condition management.\n\n - 2+ years managing a call center or borrower success team in a high-performance environment.\n\n - Demonstrated ability to motivate teams, drive results, and meet or exceed production goals.\n\n - Deep understanding of pipeline management, borrower communication, and operational execution within regulated environments.\n\n - Highly organized, data-minded, and skilled at identifying workflow inefficiencies.\n\n - Excellent communicator with a clear, confident, and empathetic leadership style.\n\n - NMLS licensed or willing to obtain licensing within 60 days of hire.\n\n - Experience with manufactured housing or chattel loans is a strong plus.\n\n - Preferred location: Dallas, Phoenix, or San Antonio.\n\n - Fluent in Spanish.\n\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\nYou thrive in fast-paced, results-oriented environments where success is measured by impact and momentum. You\u2019re a natural motivator who blends operational rigor with people-first leadership - just as comfortable jumping on the phones as you are strategizing at a high level. You analyze data to make informed decisions, collaborate across departments to improve systems, and are relentless about helping your team be more effective every day. You model Zippy\u2019s values of owning it, being results driven, and the golden rule while driving exceptional borrower experiences that lead to tangible business growth.\n\nImportant Applicant Information\n\n - While many of our interviews are conducted virtually, all applicants should be prepared to potentially meet in person as part of the process.\n\n - As a participating employer, we will use E-Verify to confirm employment eligibility.\n\n - Please note that we are currently only hiring candidates who reside in the following states: Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.
