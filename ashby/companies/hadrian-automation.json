By combining advanced software, robotics, and full-stack manufacturing, we are reinventing how America produces its most critical parts.\n\nWe recently raised $260 million dollar Series C to accelerate this mission. We are excited to be launching a new Factory in Mesa, Arizona, a 270,000 square foot facility that will create 350 new jobs immediately. We are opening a new headquarters to support thousands of future hires, launching Hadrian Maritime to serve naval production, and introducing a Factory-as-a-Service model that delivers complete systems instead of individual parts.\n\nHadrian works with startups, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and major defense contractors across space, shipbuilding, and aviation to scale production, reduce costs, and accelerate delivery on mission-critical programs. We are backed by leading investors including Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz. Our fast-growing team is united by a shared mission to reindustrialize American manufacturing for the 21st century and beyond!\n\nThe Role\n\nHadrian\u2019s Factory Automation team builds the software and interfaces that power next-generation manufacturing. The team works at the intersection of robotics, machining, and factory operations, transforming complex workflows into clear, effective digital tools.\n\nOur mission is to scale Hadrian\u2019s core machining business across multiple factories in the U.S. by building the tools that operators, technicians, and systems depend on every day. We move quickly, ship continuously, and turn real factory needs into production-ready products.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\n - Build high-performance web applications that power and monitor robotic manufacturing cells.\n\n - Design and develop visualization tools that help technicians understand and debug complex systems.\n\n - Collaborate across software, robotics, and operations to turn real workflows into intuitive UIs.\n\n - Architect scalable frontend systems using React, TypeScript, and modern tooling.\n\n - Contribute to our shared component library and design system for automation products.\n\n - Participate in reviews and help shape engineering quality and best practices.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\n\n - Have 3\u20136 years of frontend or full-stack experience building production-grade web applications.\n\n - Are fluent in TypeScript and React, or another modern frontend framework.\n\n - Strong product judgment; you think in terms of user needs, not just features.\n\n - Take initiative, move quickly, and operate with a strong sense of ownership.\n\n - Build user interfaces that balance technical depth with clarity and usability.\n\n - Enjoy working directly with experts in robotics, hardware, and manufacturing to understand use cases.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nYour work will shape how factory teams control physical systems at scale. This role puts you on the front lines of rebuilding American industrial strength by deploying software that shapes the physical world and drives the next era of automation.\n\nCompensation\n\nFor this role, the target salary range is $130,000 - $220,000 (actual range may vary based on experience).\n\nThis is the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe we would pay for this role at the time of this posting. We may ultimately pay more or less than the posted range, and the range may be modified in the future. An employee's pay position within the salary range will be based on several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, performance, and business or organizational needs.\n\nBenefits\n\n - 100% coverage of medical, dental, vision, and life insurance plans for employees\n\n - 401k\n\n - Relocation stipend if you\u2019re moving from outside of LA\n\n - Flexible vacation policy\n\nITAR Requirements\n\nTo conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
