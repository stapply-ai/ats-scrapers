They work directly with the CEO to identify critical directives, parachute into the part of the business that needs help, drive results, build processes, and then extract themselves.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Above all else, this role requires extremely high-quality judgement. The skills downstream of this: strong business acumen, analytical skills, precise communication, and finesse with customers. While specific areas of focus shift over time (DemandGen, Sales Ops, Implementation, Product, Talent, etc), individuals on this team will be working on <strong>the most important problems of today</strong>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">CoreOps is a fast-paced \u201cfuture CEO factory\u201d where ambitious generalists who want to build and sell can come to sharpen themselves surrounded by other A+ players.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Key Responsibilities:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Deliver results on mission-critical initiatives</strong>. Design, prioritize, and drive the execution of high-priority, high-scope projects, ensuring measurable outcomes that align with the company\u2019s objectives.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Navigate our organization and our customers organizations</strong>. Align leadership and ICs to make decisions and deliver results.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Build processes that drive rigor. </strong>Go in, fix something, and put in a process to make sure it stays fixed.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Obsess over talent, find it, recruit it, develop it, organize it, mobilize it.</strong> CoreOps is about systematically increasing the output of the organization by making our people and systems better.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">About You:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Exceptionally Good Judgement. </strong>In other words: you\u2019re right, a lot. We find that high-performers make very few mistakes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>High-Intensity.</strong> You have experience in high-pressure roles within finance, consulting, or startup environments. These are your <em>real preferences</em>, not your <em>stated preferences</em>.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Intellectual Firepower.</strong> You cut through noise, synthesize, and get to the right answers fast.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Technical from 1st Principles. </strong>You can grok hard engineering and logic problems from a place of intuition, not memorization.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Systems Thinker.</strong> Everything in our business is highly interconnected across people, process, and technology.

Our team re-wrote 50 years of legacy software to drive a step-function improvement in how supply chain, operations, and finance organizations execute.\n\nWe need more people to help us build and sell.\n\nPosition Overview:\n\nCore Operations (CoreOps) at Doss is a small group of \u201cexpert generalists\u201d that are mobilized around the company\u2019s hardest problems. They work directly with the CEO to identify critical directives, parachute into the part of the business that needs help, drive results, build processes, and then extract themselves.\n\nAbove all else, this role requires extremely high-quality judgement. The skills downstream of this: strong business acumen, analytical skills, precise communication, and finesse with customers. While specific areas of focus shift over time (DemandGen, Sales Ops, Implementation, Product, Talent, etc), individuals on this team will be working on the most important problems of today.\n\nCoreOps is a fast-paced \u201cfuture CEO factory\u201d where ambitious generalists who want to build and sell can come to sharpen themselves surrounded by other A+ players.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n\n - Deliver results on mission-critical initiatives. Design, prioritize, and drive the execution of high-priority, high-scope projects, ensuring measurable outcomes that align with the company\u2019s objectives.\n\n - Navigate our organization and our customers organizations. Align leadership and ICs to make decisions and deliver results.\n\n - Build processes that drive rigor. Go in, fix something, and put in a process to make sure it stays fixed.\n\n - Obsess over talent, find it, recruit it, develop it, organize it, mobilize it. CoreOps is about systematically increasing the output of the organization by making our people and systems better.\n\nAbout You:\n\n - Exceptionally Good Judgement. In other words: you\u2019re right, a lot. We find that high-performers make very few mistakes.\n\n - High-Intensity. You have experience in high-pressure roles within finance, consulting, or startup environments. These are your real preferences, not your stated preferences.\n\n - Intellectual Firepower. You cut through noise, synthesize, and get to the right answers fast.\n\n - Technical from 1st Principles. You can grok hard engineering and logic problems from a place of intuition, not memorization.\n\n - Systems Thinker. Everything in our business is highly interconnected across people, process, and technology. In order to make progress you need to be able to traverse it, untangle it, and put it back together.\n\nBonus Points:\n\n - Formal education in hard sciences, engineering, physics, or a related field.\n\n - Experience with large-scale software implementation, technical program management, or hardware engineering program management.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null,
