With some strong recent hires, we\u2019ve grown to 6 designers and are looking for a leader to manage and help uplevel the team's execution through this next phase of new product launches at Scribe!\n\nNote: We\u2019re equally split between NYC and SF, so this role requires you to be based in one of these locations.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nScribe is seeking a Designer who will lead all design functions, help expand Scribe\u2019s product experience with a focus on user value, business impact, and love of the craft.\n\nKey responsibilities for this role include:\n\n - Manage and grow a team of high-performing Product Designers, Marketing Designers, Brand Designers, and Design Engineers.\n\n - Player-coach mindset, which means both managing people and overseeing the execution of the work by diving into the details.\n\n - Strategic Alignment: Partner with your Product and Engineering counterparts to define design's role in the overall company strategy and drive execution through a roadmap.\n\n - Lead Design Rituals like critiques and sprints by establishing design principles and review processes to ensure consistency and quality across the product.\n\n - Raise the bar for our craft and quality across visual design, interaction, UX, and content, while staying focused on our user\u2019 needs and our company\u2019s goals.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Read what it\u2019s like Designing for Scribe https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cp3i5TcSexeANqwKZk9YMnsc-mCECcvw4i8auMbOiY8/edit?usp=sharing and my blurb on Why I joined Scribe https://scribehow.com/library/why-i-joined-scribe-karishma\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\nYou\u2019d be a great fit for this role, if this sounds like you:\n\n - Have 10+ years of experience designing products that customers love and 3+ years of managing high-performing design teams.\n\n - Approach situations with curiosity and love chasing the \u201cwhy, why, why\u201d to deeply understand their issues and obsess over creative designs to solve them.\n\n - Have a low ego. You care about building things and recognize that this may require rolling your sleeves up, getting in the trenches, and occasionally designing projects.\n\n - Appreciate high-ownership. You\u2019re able to translate business needs from the Company OKRs to tangible design initiatives and drive measurable outcomes.\n\n - Live for the craft of designing beautiful products. You can quickly build credibility with your product and engineering counterparts through a deep understanding of and respect for their disciplines.\n\n - Care about the details. You pride yourself on delivering the best end-to-end user experience and would never say \u201cthat\u2019s out of scope\u201d or \u201cwe can queue that up for later\u201d.\n\n - Outcomes over output. You thrive on creating user value and know when to point your team to a multi-step design framework v/s deploying a napkin sketch to make progress.\n\n - Strong POV. You can discern good products from great, and stakeholders rely on you to be the \u201ctaste test\u201d for great designs.\n\n - Experience with the latest AI tooling and ideas for how design teams can leverage them to move faster.\n\n\nBONUS POINTS\n\n - Experience designing for new 0-to-1 products, and helping drive clarity from the unambiguity of PMF in early stages\n\n - Experience working with and contributing to strong design systems.\n\n - Experience shepherding work through GitHub pull requests and giving feedback on the code our engineers are writing.\n\n - Proven track record of hiring and coaching strong designers in previous roles.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\n 1.

This will include a panel presentation, followed by a couple of behavioral interviews, and a founder chat. You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to get to know the team over lunch!\n\n 5.

Check out this post from one of our fearless product managers on what it's like to build Product at Scribe https://scribehow.com/library/what-its-like-being-a-pm-at-scribe \ud83d\ude80\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nIn this role, you will work with a talented team of 7 engineers led by the amazing Nick Rosen https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-rosen-720a989/ as your Engineering counterpart, and you will be responsible for:\n\n - Driving company-level goals and closely tracking relevant business metrics to validate/invalidate our roadmap.\n\n - Developing a vision for your product area and continuously iterating on it with input from customers, the revenue team, and the market.\n\n - Partnering closely with Engineering and Design to drive every project from ideation to launch in a way that pushes the quality bar for the product.\n\n - Being the face of Scribe. Whether it\u2019s presenting the product vision to the C-suite or responding to feature requests in our Scribe Community Slack, our PM team engages with users daily to keep a pulse on the product.\n\n - Measuring the impact of every release and using data-powered insights to inform and improve our future bets. Please leave the \u2018feature factory\u2019 mindset at the door.\n\nNote: This role requires you to be in the SF office 3 days/week.\u00a0\n\nYou could be a great fit if this sounds like you:\n\n - Extremely curious and love chasing the \u201cwhy, why, why\u201d to deeply understand user issues and obsess over creative ways to solve them.\n\n - 8+ years of building SaaS products for Enterprise customers (startup experience preferred), with experience building for different clients (Chrome extensions, Windows/Mac apps)\n\n - Appreciate the craft of building products. You can quickly build credibility with your design and engineering counterparts through a deep understanding of and respect for their disciplines.\n\n - Care about the details. You pride yourself on delivering the best end-to-end user experience and would never say \u201cthat\u2019s not my job\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s not my problem\u201d.\n\n - Deeply understand the customer. You become the go-to person for your product area and can talk someone\u2019s ear off for hours when approached about business and user questions.\n\n - Outcomes over output. You thrive on owning a company-level OKR and driving towards impact rather than just following processes and frameworks.\n\n - Highly collaborative. You recognize that your team only amplifies your impact, so you\u2019re excited to inspire and uplevel your team.\n\n - Think big and deliver incrementally. You love dreaming of \u201cbig ideas,\u201d but balance that with incrementally shipping value to our users at a high velocity.\n\n - Have a strong POV. You can discern good products from great, and stakeholders rely on you to represent the customer and market.\n\n - Thrive in autonomy. You enjoy shaping the product, not just shipping it. You identify the problems, define the roadmap, and defend your decisions with calculated trade-offs.\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nScribe https://scribehow.com/ is where exceptional people come to do the best work of their careers.
