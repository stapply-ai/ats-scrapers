We regularly hire for this position due to continued team growth and customer expansion.*\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nCandid Health is looking to hire multiple Customer Strategy & Operations team members in 2025! Over the past year, this team has grown significantly, and we\u2019re excited to bring on new talent to help drive that momentum forward and support our continued expansion.\n\nIn this role, you will own a portfolio of current customers and will be responsible for ensuring that they achieve world-class revenue cycle outcomes. You will work directly with them to understand their challenges (e.g., root causing denials issues, digging into workflow gaps), as well as cross-functionally with other internal teams at Candid to develop solutions.\u00a0\n\nThis team is at the tip of the spear working with customers helping to make medical billing less painful for everyone involved. If you are excited about what we are building, we\u2019d love to speak with you and see if there is a fit across the team!\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING\n\n - You\u2019ll interact closely with our current customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them.\n\n - You\u2019ll own significant business outcomes and be responsible for driving key metrics for the company.\n\n - You will be responsible for digging into data (i.e. performing analysis on claims metrics) to identify the root cause of customer issues and provide data informed recommendations for solutions\n\n - The solutions that you help develop may be both operational (e.g., workflow (re-)design) and/or product-oriented (e.g., automation of manual workflows)\n\n - Your main goal will be to maximize the value that Candid delivers for our customers (i.e., helping ensure a higher portion of claims get paid, more quickly, and with less effort)\n\n - You will work closely with other Candid teams, including our RCM, Customer Support, Product, Design and Engineering teams to help solve our customers most valuable and painful problems\n\n - You\u2019ll play a critical role in shaping our company culture and help make this the best place we\u2019ve ever worked.\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - 2-7 years of experience\n\n - You have a demonstrated track record of expansively owning and driving key business outcomes on high-performing teams.\n\n - You take pride in your craft and enjoy maintaining a high quality bar, but also believe that \u201cdone is better than perfect\u201d and have good intuition around which corners are okay to cut and which aren\u2019t.\n\n - You enjoy identifying problems and designing product features to address them, and aren\u2019t shy about rolling up your sleeves and getting the work done in the meantime.\n\n - You have a track record of scaling processes and operations.\n\n - You\u2019re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing.\n\n - [Optionally] You have experience in healthcare technology and/or healthcare financial services\n\n\nPAY TRANSPARENCY\n\nThe estimated starting annual salary range for this position is $95,000 - $155,000 USD. The listed range is a guideline from Pave https://www.pave.com/ data, and the actual base salary may be modified based on factors including job-related skills, experience/qualifications, interview performance, market data, etc. Total compensation for this position may also include equity, sales incentives (for sales roles), and employee benefits.
