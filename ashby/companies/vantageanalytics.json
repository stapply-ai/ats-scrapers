Build and maintain reliable partner connectors, including authentication, rate limiting, and retries. Design and evolve internal and partner-facing APIs.\n\n - Design and ship backend features and services in Python and Django with predictable latency and high reliability.\n\n - Diagnose production issues, lead debugging sessions, and improve observability using logs, metrics, and traces.\n\n - Proactively identify performance risks, create plans to eliminate them, and coach the team on best practices to prevent regressions.\n\n - Maintain strong automated test coverage and clear documentation that support safe changes and fast delivery.\n\n - Mentor engineers through pairing, design reviews, and actionable feedback that raises the standard of the team.\n\n - Contribute to architectural discussions and solutioning to ensure scalable and effective product decisions.\n\nAbout Vantage\nVantage is the first unified platform purpose-built for retail media orchestration, empowering enterprise retailers to seamlessly activate onsite, offsite, and in-store advertising.
