At no more than 20% completion of a project we must have a working prototype to test and iterate on.\n\n - Speed with Purpose. We move with urgency and focus. Slow and expensive usually go together. Good, fast, and cheap outcomes are perfectly achievable through disciplined execution.\n\n - Professional Integrity. We never speak negatively about competitors, partners, vendors, or others.

The best solution aligns with the task at hand, not necessarily with how things have always been done.\n\n - Team Over Ego. We share both successes and failures collectively. No individual's ego should surpass our commitment to the product and its impact.\n\n - Results Over Hierarchy. We do not care about titles in this company. No politics, no hierarchy. All we care about is winning together.\n\nIf you\u2019re excited to help businesses access modern money rails and believe that stablecoins will democratize finance, we\u2019d love to talk.
