At WeTravel, we get to partner with incredible tour operators to fuel their business growth, expand opportunities, and shape the future of multi-day travel.\n\nAbout WeTravel\n\nMulti-day travel businesses (think 7-day safari in the Serengeti or 5-day scuba diving in the Galapagos) use WeTravel as their all-in-one platform to manage sales processes, collect payments, and run the back office.\n\nWe monetize as a vertical SaaS for these multi-day travel businesses through transaction volume. This is possible because our clients trust WeTravel as their agent of payees, accepting payments from travelers on behalf of the travel businesses. WeTravel also acts as the merchant of record, processing the payments and handling the chargebacks. Therefore, it is undeniably essential that we protect our user funds from any bad actors, while ensuring that the funds move smoothly from pay-in (travelers) to payout (travel businesses and their suppliers).\n\n\nHOW WE WORK\n\nOur team thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving, customer-facing collaboration, and deal strategy.

Our team is leading WeTravel\u2019s evolution from a transactional product into a connected supplier network, a shift that will power our next phase of growth.<br /><br />We\u2019re still a small but mighty team: one frontend engineer, one backend engineer, one full-stack engineer, and an automation QA. We\u2019re now seeking another senior product engineer to help us evolve into a comprehensive, high-performing, and cross-functional unit.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role isn\u2019t about tickets and features, it\u2019s about product ownership and engineering leadership. You\u2019ll collaborate closely with product and design, shape architecture, run discovery with real users, and lead critical projects from idea to production. Recent initiatives include launching the Supplier Hub (our first discovery tool to connect verified suppliers with organizers), building network-aware coordination features like Rooming Lists, and scaling our payment infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">WeTravel is becoming the operating system for the multi-day travel industry, used by organizers everywhere from Patagonia to Bali to manage trips, collect payments, book vendors, and now, build trusted supplier relationships.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re solving meaningful challenges: designing fault-tolerant systems for cross-border payments, building intuitive UX for complex workflows, and architecting the foundation for platform network effects.

This means more than just writing code; it\u2019s about ensuring the things you ship are reliable, maintainable, and impactful in production.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our team works with a high degree of autonomy and shared responsibility. We don\u2019t see speed and quality as a trade-off.

Our platform makes it simple for organizers to create beautiful trip proposals, securely process payments, and manage their customers, so they can focus on what they do best: creating amazing experiences.\n\nThis is one of the last great frontiers of travel to come online, and as the category leader, we are at the forefront of this change. Last year alone, our platform was trusted by 8,000 organizers to lead over a million travelers on adventures in 150+ countries. Now, we\u2019re on an exciting journey to grow from powering $1B to $10B in travel experiences per year.\n\nWe believe that every trip, when done right, can be a force for good - and we\u2019re building the engine to make more of that possible.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role\n\nEvery great adventure has a moment of truth: the decision to click \"book.\" Our team owns this moment.

We need to give our organizers more powerful tools and flexibility to manage group changes, and handle real-world events with speed and ease.\n\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do day-to-day\n\n - Lead a team between 6 and 10 engineers.\n\n - Refine our booking management lifecycle as we expand our product portfolio - removing the friction and effort required to book, manage or otherwise adjust the bookings on our platform as it grows.\n\n - Drive the evolution of our order management system and the engine that powers our expansion in new lines of travel products and businesses.\n\n - Partner with our Product, Business and Finance teams to define the strategy and execution plan for our Booking and Order management platform.\n\n - Lead the long-term technical strategy for the domain.\n\n - Lead and grow a high-performing team of engineers\n\n - Foster a culture of ownership, excellence and collaboration.\n   \n\nHow we work\n\n - We\u2019re focused on the impact.
