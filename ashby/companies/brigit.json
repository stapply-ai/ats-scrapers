We\u2019ve found tremendous traction helping low income Americans make ends meet; now is the time to scale.  We\u2019ve built a mobile/web app on <strong>React </strong>and <strong>React Native</strong> with <strong>Typescript</strong>, and a backend of <strong>Java</strong> services in <strong>Google Cloud</strong>. It\u2019s served us well so far, but we need help making it even better.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Our team has two main goals:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">1) <strong>Feature development supporting numerous external and internal applications</strong>. The next generation of our product may look nothing like it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we implement new user flows, compute our proprietary algorithms, integrate with 3rd party APIs, store data, and serve traffic will make or break our success.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">2) <strong>Scalability of our customer-facing applications.</strong> Growing from 100k to 10 million users presents unique technical challenges. The efficiency and reliability of both our customer-facing and internal tools needs to improve. We have fun Data Engineering tasks, automation procedures, and availability/monitoring problems to tackle. We also have many user-facing projects, including the creation and upkeep of components and libraries, GraphQL API design, testing and QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our team is small and nimble; you'll be given an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you have a large say in the direction of the company -- both in terms of our technology and our product.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Recent accomplishments of our team are:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Building a Payments API platform that moves millions of dollars on a daily basis</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implementing the advanced mathematical processes behind our proprietary risk algorithm</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Normalizing relational database schema to optimize for performance for over 1 million users</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">End to end User notification (via SMS, Email, Push) capabilities</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Building internal tools that enable our Customer Support Specialists to help our customers ASAP</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">One of our greatest strengths is the speed at which we move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Brigit you can enjoy a mature CI/CD platform with automated deployment processes, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps.  We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that helps people.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As a fullstack engineer we\u2019re looking for someone with experience owning a feature from start to finish on both the frontend and backend. We don\u2019t expect everyone to know everything in our stack, but having one side of overlap (frontend/backend) that you feel very comfortable with will set you up for success here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>*This is a full-time role which will operate out of Brigit\u2019s New York office, with the option to work remote 2-3x per week.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What You'll Be Doing:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Evolving the APIs supporting User flows to ensure a great user experience</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimizing queries and relational database schema to ensure speedy response times</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implementing algorithms related to monetary transaction evaluation, risk management, income verification, and other predictive models</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Integrating with new 3rd party APIs to serve millions of customers</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Decreasing our customer service workload by building improvements to the product or improving our internal automations</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Automating visual testing &amp; visual regression detection processes</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Creating new mobile &amp; web clients for upcoming products</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A/B testing and optimizing features that boost our business\u2019 bottom line</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>What you have:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>6+ years</strong> of industry experience as a software engineer</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">REST based services and API development experience mainly using Java</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end using React or React Native</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">GraphQL experience a plus</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Up-to-date grasp of the constantly evolving JS language standards, ES6 and beyond (we use Typescript)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience with SQL databases, constructing schemas, performing migrations and writing analytical queries</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Kubernetes, Docker or other container system experience is a plus</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Quantitative skills, knowledge or experience in Finance is a plus</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience leading teams or mentoring junior engineers is a plus</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are a self-starter, self-motivated, and able to work independently and manage multiple projects under minimal supervision</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>The Interview Process:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em><strong>Technical Interview, Java, Testing and Debugging</strong> <strong>-</strong> </em>Pair program with an engineer using HackerRank.

We\u2019ve found tremendous traction helping low income Americans make ends meet; now is the time to scale. We\u2019ve built a mobile/web app on React and React Native with Typescript, and a backend of Java services in Google Cloud. It\u2019s served us well so far, but we need help making it even better.\n\nOur team has two main goals:\n\n1) Feature development supporting numerous external and internal applications. The next generation of our product may look nothing like it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we implement new user flows, compute our proprietary algorithms, integrate with 3rd party APIs, store data, and serve traffic will make or break our success.\n\n2) Scalability of our customer-facing applications. Growing from 100k to 10 million users presents unique technical challenges. The efficiency and reliability of both our customer-facing and internal tools needs to improve. We have fun Data Engineering tasks, automation procedures, and availability/monitoring problems to tackle. We also have many user-facing projects, including the creation and upkeep of components and libraries, GraphQL API design, testing and QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.\n\nOur team is small and nimble; you'll be given an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you have a large say in the direction of the company -- both in terms of our technology and our product.\n\nRecent accomplishments of our team are:\n\n - Building a Payments API platform that moves millions of dollars on a daily basis\n\n - Implementing the advanced mathematical processes behind our proprietary risk algorithm\n\n - Normalizing relational database schema to optimize for performance for over 1 million users\n\n - End to end User notification (via SMS, Email, Push) capabilities\n\n - Building internal tools that enable our Customer Support Specialists to help our customers ASAP\n\nOne of our greatest strengths is the speed at which we move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on.\n\nAt Brigit you can enjoy a mature CI/CD platform with automated deployment processes, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps. We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that helps people.\n\nAs a fullstack engineer we\u2019re looking for someone with experience owning a feature from start to finish on both the frontend and backend. We don\u2019t expect everyone to know everything in our stack, but having one side of overlap (frontend/backend) that you feel very comfortable with will set you up for success here.\n\n*This is a full-time role which will operate out of Brigit\u2019s New York office, with the option to work remote 2-3x per week.\n\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\n - Evolving the APIs supporting User flows to ensure a great user experience\n\n - Optimizing queries and relational database schema to ensure speedy response times\n\n - Implementing algorithms related to monetary transaction evaluation, risk management, income verification, and other predictive models\n\n - Integrating with new 3rd party APIs to serve millions of customers\n\n - Decreasing our customer service workload by building improvements to the product or improving our internal automations\n\n - Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences\n\n - Automating visual testing & visual regression detection processes\n\n - Creating new mobile & web clients for upcoming products\n\n - A/B testing and optimizing features that boost our business\u2019 bottom line\n\nWhat you have:\n\n - 6+ years of industry experience as a software engineer\n\n - REST based services and API development experience mainly using Java\n\n - Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end using React or React Native\n\n - GraphQL experience a plus\n\n - Up-to-date grasp of the constantly evolving JS language standards, ES6 and beyond (we use Typescript)\n\n - Experience with SQL databases, constructing schemas, performing migrations and writing analytical queries\n\n - Kubernetes, Docker or other container system experience is a plus\n\n - Quantitative skills, knowledge or experience in Finance is a plus\n\n - Experience leading teams or mentoring junior engineers is a plus\n\n - You are a self-starter, self-motivated, and able to work independently and manage multiple projects under minimal supervision\n\nThe Interview Process:\n\n - Technical Interview, Java, Testing and Debugging - Pair program with an engineer using HackerRank. This interview will be in Java and is an exercise meant to show off your fundamental coding skills. In this session, you\u2019ll work with an engineer to test, debug, and fix a faulty data structure implementation.\n\n - Team Behavioral + Take Home Project\n   \n   - Team Behavioral - Meet with one of our Engineering Managers to discuss your approach to collaboration, communication, and alignment with our team values and culture.\n   \n   - Take Home Project, React - You will be asked to re-create a simple game of Black Jack. This is an opportunity to showcase your process and approach for creating a working realish-world feature/product in a React environment.\n\n - Final Interviews\n   \n   - Technical Interview, System Design - Meet with an engineer and work through API-related business problems.\n   \n   - Take Home Follow-Up - In this interview, the team will walk through your initial Blackjack assessment with you. They\u2019ll review the overall structure, discuss any bugs or issues they\u2019ve identified, and work with you to add additional functionality or enhancements to the project.\n   \n   - Technical Interview, Service Architecture - Meet with one last engineer for a conversational interview around your architecture-related experience.\n\nThe anticipated annual base salary for this position is $165,000 - $180,000.
