Our diverse team hails from 42 nationalities, with backgrounds ranging from self-taught DeFi natives to PhDs. Predominantly remote, we have hubs in London, Brussels, and Singapore, and host regular online and offline hangouts to keep the crew tight.\n\nWe are trading on more than 80 exchanges, and working with a wide array of asset issuers. As a well-established market maker, our distinctive expertise led us to expand rapidly. Today, our services span market making, options trading, high-frequency trading, OTC, and DeFi trading desks.\n\nBut we\u2019re more than a service provider. We\u2019re an initiator. We're pioneers in adopting the Rust Development language for our algorithmic trading, and champions of its use in the industry. We support the growth of Web3 startups through our Accelerator Program. We upgrade ecosystems by injecting liquidity into promising DeFi, RWA, and NFT protocols. And we push the industry's progress with our research and governance initiatives.\n\nAt Keyrock, we're not just envisioning the future of digital assets. We're actively building it.\n\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nWe are seeking a highly technical, hands-on Technical Product Manager to join our team and act as the internal, central hub for core services and automation that support trading business units at Keyrock. This is a role for a builder at heart\u2014someone who can not only identify opportunities but also rapidly prototype solutions. You will be pivotal in assessing technical solutions (buy vs build), connecting APIs, building proofs of concept, and driving the integration of cutting-edge technology to solve critical business challenges.\n\nWorking in close coordination with the VP of Product, and in support of the COO office and VP of Engineering, you will bridge the gap between idea and implementation with a focus on the non-trading teams of Keyrock. Your primary responsibility is to assess outcomes and value (prioritisation) and translate complex needs into tangible, working prototypes, demonstrating value and technical feasibility firsthand, in alignment with the VP Engineering and software development practices at Keyrock. A strong background in software development is therefore essential for this role. You will support critical visibility and communication at the centre of Keyrock, paving the way for our engineering teams to build and scale the proven solutions you have discovered and proven.\n\nKeyrock Product Managers are responsible for developing valuable and viable systems (& implicit services) that consider the voices of\n\n 1.

You'll run regular meetings with these teams, together with leaders from product, engineering, and architecture to find problems early, understand how projects depend on each other, and spot chances to improve how we work together.\n\n - Technology Assessment & Prioritisation: You will help us make smart technology choices. You'll figure out what our teams need, decide whether it's better to build our own solution or buy one, and use clear data to balance what's valuable for the business against how hard it is to build.\n\n - Technical Solution discovery, design & prototyping: You will quickly build working models to test out new ideas. You'll be hands-on, creating functional prototypes to see if a concept is worth pursuing before we invest heavily in it.\n\n - Stakeholder Communication & Central Operations: You will be the initial product & tech contact for our business operations and back-office teams. You'll explain our technology plans in simple terms to everyone, ensuring we're all on the same page, and help our central Platform team explore new product ideas.\n\n - Engineering Collaboration & Systems Integration: When needed, you will design and build the first versions of new solutions to see how they fit into our existing systems, following guidance from our senior engineering and product leaders.
