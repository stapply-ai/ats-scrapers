Expect a fast-paced, hands-on environment where your contributions directly influence production and growth.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\nOptimize Metallurgical Processes - Monitor and improve metallurgical performance across heap leach pads, SX/EW plants, flotation circuits, and comminution areas (crushing/milling). Identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and implement improvements to enhance throughput and recovery.\n\nDesign and Execute Test Program - Plan and supervise metallurgical testwork (e.g., column leach tests, flotation tests, grinding studies). Interpret results to support operational changes or project decisions.\n\nTrack and Report Metallurgical Performance - Conduct routine sampling, analysis, and metallurgical accounting. Maintain accurate records of metallurgical balances, recoveries, and plant efficiency metrics. Prepare internal reports and contribute to monthly technical summaries.\n\nCollaborate Across Teams - Work with operations, maintenance, and geology teams to integrate metallurgical insights into daily decision-making. Provide input to capital projects, equipment selection, and commissioning activities.\n\nChampion Safety and Compliance - Promote a strong safety culture and ensure that all metallurgical work aligns with environmental, health, and regulatory standards.\n\nWhat You'll Bring\n\n - 3\u20137 years of experience in mineral processing, ideally with exposure to both hydrometallurgical and flotation circuits.\n\n - Strong understanding of heap leach dynamics, SX/EW systems, flotation chemistry, and comminution fundamentals.\n\n - Skilled in metallurgical test design, data analysis, and performance optimization.\n\n - Experience with metallurgical modeling and software tools such as METSIM, HSC, or similar process modeling software package\n\n - Strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n - Excellent communication skills\u2014able to translate technical findings into actionable recommendations.\n\n - Proactive, safety-conscious, and results-driven, with a collaborative mindset.\n\n - Ability to thrive in a field-based, production-focused environment.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "7f61d94d-9fdc-41ed-8d06-723d9ba2d8e2", "title": "Electrician", "department": "Plant Operations", "team": "Plant Operations", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "East Texas", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-06-13T13:53:44.576+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Texas", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Joaquin"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/marianaminerals/7f61d94d-9fdc-41ed-8d06-723d9ba2d8e2", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/marianaminerals/7f61d94d-9fdc-41ed-8d06-723d9ba2d8e2/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>POSITION DESCRIPTION:</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>\u00a0</strong>The Mariana Minerals Electrician will provide competent and effective electrical support to our Refinery operations in East Texas.
