We are at the frontier of applying agents to real world problems both for our customers and internally in our own work. Everyone at Basis knows that, your job will be to make sure the rest of the world knows that.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Location: NYC, Flatiron office. In-person team.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\n - Write\n   \n   Basis has a written-first culture, because we believe that to write clearly is to think clearly.\n   \n   We like to write publicly (see here https://www.getbasis.ai/about, here https://www.getbasis.ai/blogs/were-hiring-agent-managers, and here https://www.getbasis.ai/blogs/introducing-deployed-intelligence) but we don\u2019t do it nearly often enough.

We are optimizing for the best folks and happy to compensate generously\n\nIn accordance with New York State regulations, the salary range for this position is $100,000\u2013$300,000.
