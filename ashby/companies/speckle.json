SPECKLE\n\nAt Speckle, we\u2019re on a mission to shake up the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To do that, we're building the data layer for AEC to operationalize how the built environment industry works with data and automation. Think of us as a cross between Github and Palantir, with an opportunity to significantly impact a $10 trillion industry. Our platform already powers workflows on billion dollar projects at leading firms like Suffolk, Multiconsult, Pomerleau, and Stantec.\n\nNow, we're focused on taking a paradigm-shifting product and bringing it to as many customers as possible. We're building a generational company that will revolutionize the way one of the world's largest industries works. We\u2019re doing that by breaking down barriers and connecting architects, engineers, and designers across every project stage with their design data.\n\nSpeckle is backed by top-tier investors, working with some of the most innovative teams in AEC who are tired of outdated workflows and ready to transform how their organizations use data. Our dynamic team is spread across the U.S. and Europe, we value flexibility and hold regular in-person working sessions to keep us moving in the same direction, quickly.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nWe're looking for an Sales Development Representative who thrives in the early stages of sales, someone who gets energized by prospecting, loves building pipeline from scratch, and isn't afraid to figure things out as they go. You'll be our first SDR focused on new business, which means you'll help shape how we sell, who we sell to, and how we grow.\n\nThis isn't a role where you'll inherit a polished playbook. You'll be building it with us.\n\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nYou\u2019ll be part of our Growth team. At Speckle, we\u2019re a small, high-performing team building something ambitious. We move fast, default to action, and give talented people room to run.\n\nWe\u2019re building a rocketship and we move fast. We don't have layers of management or endless meetings, we have smart people who take ownership, ship quickly, and learn from what works (and what doesn't). If you need someone to tell you what to do every day, this isn't the place for you.\n\nWhat makes our culture different:\n\n - We hire for trajectory, not pedigree. We care more about what you're capable of becoming than where you've been. If you're hungry, ambitious, and want to level up fast, we'll give you the runway to do it.\n\n - We default to trust and autonomy. You'll have real ownership and impact on product/customers/growth from day one. We don't micromanage and we hire people who don't need it.\n\n - We move fast and expect you to keep pace. Startup speed isn't for everyone. We make decisions quickly, test hypotheses, and iterate. If you thrive in structure and stability, you'll hate it here. If you love building something from zero, you'll love it.\n\n - We punch above our weight. We're a small team working with industry giants. Our customers include some of the most innovative firms in AEC, and they expect excellence and enterprise-grade stability. We deliver.\n\n - We invest in curious, ambitious people who embrace a growth mindset. If you're constantly asking \"what if?\" and \"why not?\", see challenges as opportunities to learn, and help your teammates level up too, we'll back you with mentorship, resources, and bigger opportunities.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\nWe're looking for a strategic-minded Sales Development Representative who wants to build something from the ground up. You\u2019ll own the top of our funnel, establish our outbound motion, and set the foundation for our sales development function.\n\nThe opportunity: If you perform, you'll have a clear path to promotion into an Account Executive role within 12-18 months, with the potential to build and manage your own business development team as we scale.\n\nThis isn't a traditional SDR grind. You'll have real influence on how we go to market, who we target, and how we build our sales engine. Your responsibilities will break down as follows:\n\nPipeline generation (60% of your time):\n\n - Own outbound prospecting: Build target account lists, run multi-channel outreach campaigns, and book qualified meetings for our Account Executives\n\n - Qualify inbound leads: Respond to demo requests, assess fit, and route high-quality opportunities\n\n - Experiment and iterate: Test messaging, identify ideal customer profiles, and figure out what resonates with AEC decision-makers\n\n - Hit aggressive targets: Generate consistent pipeline that converts to closed revenue\n\nProcess building (40% of your time):\n\n - Establish SDR workflows: Set up sequences, build out our CRM, create playbooks, and document what's working\n\n - Develop enablement materials: Create talk tracks, objection handling guides, and qualification frameworks\n\n - Collaborate with leadership: Work directly with our CEO and Head of Growth to refine our go-to-market strategy\n\n - Prepare to scale: Build the foundation for growing the team as our customer base scales\n\n\nYOUR PROFILE\n\n - 2-3 years of experience in sales development, business development, or outbound sales: You've built pipeline before and know what good prospecting looks like\n\n - Proven track record of hitting or exceeding quota: You have the numbers to back it up\n\n - Startup experience: You've worked in an early-stage environment where you had to build workflows, set up CRM processes, and create structure from scratch\n\n - Entrepreneurial mindset: You're willing to do the work yourself while thinking about how to scale it\n\n - Strong communicator: You can explain complex concepts clearly and adapt your pitch based on your audience\n\n - Self-motivated and ambitious: You want to move up quickly and are willing to put in the work to earn it\n\nNice-to-haves:\n\n - Experience selling technical products or platforms (SaaS, developer tools, data infrastructure)\n\n - Familiarity with AEC, architecture, engineering, construction, or adjacent industries\n\n - Experience with modern sales tools (HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn Sales Navigator)\n\n - Background in building outbound processes\n\n\nWHY US?\n\n - Shape the role: You won't be executing someone else's playbook, you'll help write it!\n\n - Work with innovators: Our customers are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AEC data.\n\n - Real impact: Your work directly influences our growth and the industry's transformation.\n\n - Learn constantly: You'll be exposed to cutting-edge workflows, automation, and how leading firms are preparing for the future.\n\n - Remote-first culture: Work from anywhere with a team that values autonomy and trust.\n\n - Competitive compensation: Base salary + uncapped commission + generous equity.\n\n - Generous vacation policy: So you can disconnect and recharge.\n\n - Annual allowance of 2K GBP: Learn something new or take care of yourself and your family.\n\n - In-person collaboration: We believe in value of in-person collaboration, so every year we bring all Specklers on a unique and exciting retreats somewhere warm, with frequent in-person IRL meetups in between.\n\n -
