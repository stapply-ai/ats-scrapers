For example, knowledge of how to test machine learning models, data pipelines, or AI APIs as part of an automation suite is a big plus.\n\n - Exposure to AI/ML frameworks and libraries (even if not as a developer, as a user of the outputs) \u2013 e.g., understanding how an LLM-powered feature might be tested for quality or how to automate validation of data processing tasks.\n\n - Prior experience working in a startup or fast-paced product team environment, especially on enterprise SaaS or data platform products.\n\n - Contributions to open-source automation tools or frameworks, or active participation in QA/DevOps communities, demonstrating your passion for the craft.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\n\nMust-have:\n\n - Playwright (or similar end-to-end testing frameworks) for UI and functional test automation.\n\n - CI/CD tools: such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI for building automated pipelines.\n\n - Version Control: Git (experience with branching strategies, pull request workflows, and merge processes in a team setting).\n\n - Containers: Docker (writing Dockerfiles, managing container images) and Kubernetes (deploying services, configuring pods, services, ingress, etc.).\n\n - Cloud Services: Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) and deploying/monitoring applications in cloud environments.\n\n - Scripting & Programming: Strong scripting skills in Python and/or JavaScript/TypeScript. Ability to write clean, maintainable code for automation tasks and test scripts.\n\n - Monitoring & Logging: Basic knowledge of tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or similar for observing test environments and catching issues. (You\u2019ll work closely with SREs, but it\u2019s helpful to understand how to verify that deployments are healthy.)\n\nNice-to-have:\n\n - Infrastructure as Code: Experience with Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation to automate provisioning of infrastructure.\n\n - Performance Testing: Familiarity with performance or load testing tools (JMeter, Locust, k6, etc.) to ensure our services can scale under load.\n\n - Security/Compliance Automation: Any experience automating security tests (SAST/DAST) or compliance checks in the pipeline.\n\n - AI/ML Tools: Exposure to testing data pipelines, ML model validation tools, or frameworks like MLflow, which could be useful as we build out our AI features (not mandatory, but will help in the role).\n\n\n\nWHY JOIN ALTIMATE AI?\n\n - Build Cutting-Edge AI Products: As an Automation Engineer, you\u2019ll directly contribute to the quality of industry-leading AI solutions that are transforming how enterprise data teams work.
