Time, cost, and lack of access to expertise hold teams back. In today\u2019s AI-powered world, anyone can build a product fast. The real challenge? Deeply understanding user needs and building the right product. That\u2019s where Maze comes in.\n\nWe believe companies shouldn\u2019t have to choose between building fast and building right. Maze makes research accessible, intuitive, and fast so product teams can put user insights at the center of every decision.\n\nOur platform enables researchers, designers, and product managers to quickly recruit participants, run studies autonomously, and surface insights that actually drive product decisions. Our AI capabilities automate the busywork and add depth and direction to the insights themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s why Maze was recently named the #1 user research platform in UX Tools\u2019 Design Tools Survey https://www.uxtools.co/survey/user-research/user-testing-overview\u2014and why we\u2019re scaling fast across industries like B2B SaaS, e-Commerce, Financial Services, Retail, and Automotive, supporting world class customers such as Uber, Amazon, Atlassian, Anthropic & more.\n\nMaze is a Series B company backed by top-tier investors (Felicis, Emergence & Amplify).
