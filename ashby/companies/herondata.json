You can take responsibility over the end-to-end deployment of what you build.\n\n - Thrive at solving tough technical problems: you enjoy breaking down challenges into simple and well-designed solutions. You are fact-oriented and thoughtful in your approach, but you don\u2019t get bogged down in over-intellectualizing or over-complicating things.\n\n - Scale-oriented: while having a bias to action and impact, you will care about scalable infrastructure and engineering processes. Even better if you\u2019re able to bring some better practices or improvements to our infrastructure or ways of working!\n\n - Be able to contribute in our stack: we try to balance speed and impact with fitting the best framework/ technology to the task at hand. Currently, we work primarily in Python / Flask / FastAPI on the backend, Terraform / GCP / AWS for infra, and React / JavaScript / TypeScript / Vercel on the frontend. Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to contribute within our stack while also helping us experiment and evolve to continually improve functionality and performance.\n\nAbove all else, we value people who want to make an impact in their work. Here are some of the behaviors that we expect of all Herons:\n\n - Scrappy and creative: when faced with an obstacle, you will either overcome it by pure determination (i.e., by hand), or find an unconventional approach or \u2018hack\u2019 to navigate it.\n\n - Persistent: you may not always find the right answer or person immediately, but you're motivated to keep on trying until you do so. You\u2019ll go the extra mile - including Flying to Gainesville - if that\u2019s what it takes.\n\n - Pilot not passenger: at a fast-growing company like Heron we need people who jump on opportunities unprompted and drive them to a great outcome, rather than folks who wait to be told what to do.\n\n - Excited to work in a fast-paced, high-growth, team-based environment: we aim to move quickly and decisively, but together. You\u2019ll be a great team player and do what it takes for the team to succeed.\n\n\nWHAT YOU CAN EXPECT AS A HERON\n\n - Competitive compensation, including equity\n\n - Based full-time in London, where most of the team is in-person multiple days per week\n\n - Your choice of top-of-the-line equipment to fit out your desk in the office\n\n - Occasional travel to NYC for retreats and to work with the team there\n\n - Competitive benefits: health insurance; pension; uncapped annual leave; parental leave\n\n - Free mental health support via Spill - on-demand access to therapy\n\n - Weekly company lunches (always inclusive and vegan-friendly - especially if you like Korean or Vietnamese food!)\n\n - Applicants from any background and gender are welcome and we have a zero tolerance policy on discrimination\n\n\nABOUT THE INTERVIEW\n\n - Initial screen (20 minutes) - conversation to discuss what you're looking for, what Heron offers, and to see if there's a good fit.\n\n - Technical screening interview (up to 60 minutes) - interactive technical session with one or two of our engineers where you will review a pull request and then do some live coding to build on it.\n\n - Team interviews (2-3 hours in total) - mix of technical and behavioral conversations with Heron teammates and founders. You'll get a feel for the people you'll work with and how we approach problems, and we'll get to know how you collaborate, communicate, and think.\n\n - References - 2 references from people you've worked with who can speak to your impact, working style, and contributions in a professional setting.\n\n\nABOUT HERON DATA\n\nWe are Heron Data https://www.herondata.io/, a Series A stage company based in New York and London.\n\n - At Heron, we use the latest advances in AI and LLMs to automate document processing.

Of our 100+ customers, all but a few were acquired directly by one of our founders (Jamie). Our current lead list is much larger than we can deal with. You will lead the charge as we dramatically ramp up, and have the opportunity to share in our growth and earn significant upside via commission.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Personal growth opportunities</strong>: as we grow, we\u2019re able to offer Herons larger and different opportunities that are aligned with their interests. Depending on your ambitions, this role could develop in many ways: closing very large and complex deals, a sales leadership role, or leading go-to-market for product expansions - just to name a few options.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>An environment where you can do your best work</strong>: we promote an outcome-focused, low-bureaucracy work environment with an emphasis on impact.

You\u2019ll use a mix of high-volume outbound and more specific, account-based techniques. You\u2019ll also work with our product and engineering team to identify and prioritize features that prospective customers need.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Across the business</strong>: you have a unique opportunity to work across our business: interacting with many prospects every day, building deep relationships with customers as they become users while also having a front-row seat and input into how we build our product.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Be present with our customers</strong>: working out of our New York office in Soho, you\u2019ll be comfortable traveling regularly across the US to conferences, industry events, and customer sites to ensure we are top of mind for decision makers in our customers.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What we're looking for</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our ideal hire will have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Demonstrated sales excellence</strong>: 3+ years in B2B sales with a track record of high achievement and quota attainment.

You\u2019ll go the extra mile - including Flying to Gainesville - if that\u2019s what it takes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Be metrics-driven</strong>: you thrive on meeting and smashing through your targets, and are motivated by having your impact on the business measured and visible.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Excited to work in a fast-paced, high-growth, team-based environment</strong>: we aim to move quickly and decisively, but together.
