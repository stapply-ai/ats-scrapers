We're looking for our first AI Platform Engineer to design, build, and own the central nervous system for our machine learning and large language model (LLM) initiatives.\n\nThis isn't a typical MLOps role. You won't just be managing pipelines; you'll be the architect of our AI infrastructure, creating the paved road that enables our product and AI teams to ship features faster, safer, and smarter. You will be the force multiplier for all things AI at Monarch, making critical decisions on everything from our retrieval architecture to how we manage a multi-model LLM strategy.\n\nYou'll collaborate closely with our Infrastructure team, who manage the underlying cloud, networking, and compute fabric. Your focus will be on the entire ML/LLM application layer: reliability, evaluation, safety, observability, and performance.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\n\n - Build the Central AI Platform: Design and build a unified, resilient platform for deploying and serving AI features.
