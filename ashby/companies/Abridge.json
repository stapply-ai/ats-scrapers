Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most\u2014their patients.\n\nOur enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.\n\nWe are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the Mission District in San Francisco, the SoHo neighborhood of New York, and East Liberty in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAbridge is growing rapidly, and we\u2019re looking for a Senior Product Operations Manager to help our product organization scale with excellence. You\u2019ll drive clarity, unlock execution, and ensure our product managers and builders can focus on creating user value. Day-to-day, you\u2019ll be embedded within our Builders org and act as a key operating partner to product leadership, while reporting into Operations to bring added discipline, alignment, and cross-functional leverage. This is a hands-on, high-impact role for a structured thinker with GSD energy who loves building the operating system of a world-class product org.\n\nReporting to the COO, you\u2019ll turn product goals into actionable plans, maintaining the roadmap as a source of truth, and ensuring launches, comms, and enablement run smoothly.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO\n\nPlanning & Alignment\n\n - Maintain the product org\u2019s single sources of truth, including living roadmap, goals, and feedback tracking.\n\n - Build a product operating system that stays ahead of the curve, anticipating needs before they surface.\n\n - Facilitate quarterly roadmap reviews, collecting cross-functional inputs and prepping for cross-functional reviews.\n\n - Cascade product updates across the company (e.g., newsletters, All Hands), ensuring clarity and consistency.\n\nLaunch Operations & GTM Enablement\n\n - Own the release process end-to-end, including readiness criteria, beta programs, commitments, and launch playbooks.\n\n - Partner with Marketing and Success to deliver enablement (training, FAQs, release notes, demos).\n\n - Facilitate ongoing product metrics reviews with Product, Data Science, and GTM leaders.\n\nKnowledge & Tooling\n\n - Build and maintain an internal knowledge base for product/GTM teams.\n\n - Centralize, prioritize, and tag customer feedback, route it to the right PMs, and ensure inputs are reviewed in roadmap forums.\n\nExecution Excellence\n\n - Track dependencies and surface risks early, with recommended options for resolution.\n\n - Build onboarding materials for new PMs and accelerate their time to impact.\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL BRING\n\n - 3-5+ years in consulting, strategy & operations, product ops, investing, or similar roles\n\n - Analytical thinker who approaches problem from first principles and can design product operating systems that fit the context, not just apply playbooks\n\n - Skilled at driving alignment across stakeholders, distilling complexity, and communicating with clarity\n\n - High EQ and ability to influence without authority, earning trust from PMs, engineers, GTM leaders, and executives alike.\n\n - Bias to action and comfort with ambiguity: you\u2019re as comfortable building the system as running it until it sticks.\n\nThis is a hybrid role with a minimum of 3 days weekly in our San Francisco office.\n\n\nWHY WORK AT ABRIDGE?\n\nAt Abridge, we\u2019re transforming healthcare delivery experiences with generative AI, enabling clinicians and patients to connect in deeper, more meaningful ways.
