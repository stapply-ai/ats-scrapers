With this continued growth, Onebrief is able to make an impact where it matters most.\n\nRequired: Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI\n\nIn person in Camp Smith, HI.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE\n\nYour mission\n\nAs a Partner Engagement Manger you will,\n\n - Own the entire customer relationship, from users up to Generals.\n\n - Rapidly expand product usage until ~100% of G-35 and G-5 plans are in Onebrief. You\u2019ll need a combination of ordinary training and subtler strategies to get our product used as much as possible.\n\n - Clearly communicate user needs to the product team. Maintain a high product proficiency, and excite the customer about each product improvement.\n\n - Instill the Onebrief brand image.\n\n - Enable our expansion to Allies and Partners.\n\n - Your responsibilities aren\u2019t limited to this list! We\u2019re on this great adventure together, and we\u2019ll each do what it takes for the team to succeed.\n\nYou will also:\n\n - Lead or support exercises.\n\n - Use your observations of our users to recommend product improvements.\n\n - Provide face-to-face and remote customer support.\n\n - Develop an understanding of customer social dynamics in order to support renewals and future sales.\n\n - When responding to incidents (product is unavailable, broken, or not delighting the customer), coordinate with the customer and our product engineering team.\n\nTo succeed, you\u2019ll need a mastery of operational planning at multi-star headquarters. When you speak, do lead planners listen? Do Generals and Admirals?\n\nYou\u2019ll also need technical skill. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - You love our users, and you want to work with them. This is the single most important requirement. Implementing new software requires the enthusiastic support of our user base \u2014 skillful planners, primarily in the grade of O-4 and O-5. You understand them, and they confide in you.\n\n - You deeply understand large military headquarters and want to apply that within MARFORPAC. Skillful planners, mainly SAMS, JAWS or SAW graduates in the rank of O-4 to O-6, respect you and care what you have to say. So do Generals and Admirals. You wake up excited each day to navigate the military and political bureaucracy and win over future customers.\n\n - You pay attention to detail. People rely on you. On your previous teams, you had a reputation as a workhorse. Example: we\u2019re about to run a planning exercise, which will be MARFOPAC's first exposure to our product. No one is worried, because they know you\u2019ve taken care of it.\n\n - You can get things from large government organizations Example: our engineer needs admin access to a system on JWICS, in order to diagnose technical issues. It\u2019s an unusual request, and no one at the customer knows what to do. Everyone tells you it\u2019s not possible, but you love a bureaucratic challenge. You solve the problem with a few phone calls\n\n - You have technical skill You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n - You work well with customers You understand them, and they confide in you.\n\n - You\u2019re intense about our mission. It\u2019s a core part of who you are\n\n - You\u2019re ambitious. We\u2019re getting bigger. You should too\n\n - You hold a current Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI\n\nQualifications\n\n - Proven experience in leading operational planning within a military context, preferably at multi-star headquarters.\n\n - Advanced military education: Command and Staff, Advanced Military Studies.\n\n - Familiarity and experience with major military planning exercises and the protocols for software deployment on classified networks.\n\n - Proven ability to expand business presence within a region, with emphasis on software or technology solutions.\n\n - Experience in customer support, both face-to-face and remote, and capability to respond to incidents coordinating with customers and product engineering teams.\n\n - Strong technical skills to master our application, troubleshoot issues and liaise with customers on technical matters.\n\n - Proven ability to navigate large government organizations, solve bureaucratic challenges, and deliver successful outcomes.\n\n - Most importantly, you are a true Onebriefer:\n   \n   - You are obsessed with creating value for real users\n   \n   - You are ambitious, scrappy, and a creative problem-solver\n   \n   - You learn quickly, work iteratively, and naturally seek collaboration\n   \n   - You approach your work with integrity, intellectual honesty, and a low ego\n   \n   - You communicate frankly, clearly, and succinctly\n   \n   - You thrive as a self-starter, embracing autonomy and ambiguity\n\n\n", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$145K \u2013 $165K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Offers Bonus", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$145K - $165K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "60ee9f76-9d49-4cc0-adeb-14018e11b427", "tierSummary": "$145K \u2013 $165K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Offers Bonus", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d67e5373-b09c-4a88-b7d2-0dfe70a6a3c4", "summary": "$145K \u2013 $165K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 145000, "maxValue": 165000}, {"id": "969a9ba0-1b3b-4ad2-b963-b9894f96475f", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "bfa72a4a-6a6a-47cc-95df-b584e60a5930", "summary": "Offers Bonus", "compensationType": "Bonus", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 145000, "maxValue": 165000}, {"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"compensationType": "Bonus", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}}, {"id": "e4f98fc8-3eee-449f-a09c-843dbf7ad7fd", "title": "Staff Software Engineer, Backend", "department": "Engineering", "team": "Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Remote", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-08-22T17:28:29.224+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": true, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "", "addressCountry": "USA", "addressLocality": ""}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/e4f98fc8-3eee-449f-a09c-843dbf7ad7fd", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/e4f98fc8-3eee-449f-a09c-843dbf7ad7fd/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h2><strong>About Onebrief</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Onebrief is collaboration and AI-powered workflow software designed specifically for military staffs.

By transforming this work, Onebrief makes the staff as a whole superhuman - meaning faster, smarter, and more efficient.\n\nWe take ownership, seek excellence, and play to win with the seriousness and camaraderie of an Olympic team. Onebrief operates as an all-remote company, though many of our employees work alongside our customers at military commands around the world.\n\nFounded in 2019 by a group of experienced planners, today, Onebrief\u2019s team spans veterans from all forces and global organizations, and technologists from leading-edge software companies. We\u2019ve raised $123m+ from top-tier investors, including Battery Ventures, General Catalyst, Insight Partners, and Human Capital, and today, Onebrief is valued at $1.1B. With this continued growth, Onebrief is able to make an impact where it matters most.\n\nRequired: Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI\n\nIn person in Anchorage, AK\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE\n\nAt each major headquarters under your responsibility,\n\n - Own the entire customer relationship, from users up to Generals/Admirals throughout the Joint Force.\n\n - Build strong relationships and trust with customers, positioning yourself as a trusted member of their team.\n\n - Rapidly expand product usage until the most important and impactful workflows are in Onebrief. You\u2019ll need a combination of ordinary training and subtler strategies to get our product used as much as possible.\n\n - Win the renewal and expansion, so that your customer(s) keep buying Onebrief each year. Deals should expand over time.\n\n - Clearly communicate user needs to the product team. Maintain a high product proficiency, and excite the customer about each product improvement.\n\n - Understand, request, and effectively leverage Company resources to meet the goals of the Company.\n\n - Instill the Onebrief brand image.\n\n - Enable our expansion to Allies and Partners.\n\n - Your responsibilities aren\u2019t limited to this list! We\u2019re on this great adventure together, and we\u2019ll each do what it takes for the team to succeed.\n\nYou will also:\n\n - Lead or support exercises.\n\n - Use your observations of our users to recommend product improvements.\n\n - Provide face-to-face and remote customer support.\n\n - Develop an understanding of customer social dynamics in order to support renewals and future sales.\n\n - When responding to incidents (product is unavailable, broken, or not delighting the customer), coordinate with the customer and our product engineering team.\n\n - Align your team\u2019s efforts to deliver the best customer experience, while coordinating with fellow Operations Managers to ensure planning and workflows remain synchronized across commands.\n\nTo succeed, you\u2019ll need a mastery of operational planning at multi-star headquarters. When you speak, do lead planners listen? Do Generals and Admirals?\n\nYou\u2019ll also need technical skill. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - You love our users, and you want to work with them. This is the single most important requirement. Implementing new software requires the enthusiastic support of our user base \u2014 skillful planners, primarily in the grade of O-4 and O-5. You understand them, and they confide in you. Users want you around, and see you as a valuable member of the team.\n\n - You deeply understand how military staffs function at echelon and want to apply that within 11th Airborne. Skillful planners, mainly SAMS, JAWS or SAW graduates in the rank of O-4 to O-6, respect you and care what you have to say. So do Generals and Admirals. You wake up excited each day to navigate the military and political bureaucracy and win over future customers.\n\n - You pay attention to detail. People rely on you. On your previous teams, you had a reputation as a workhorse. Example: we\u2019re about to run a planning exercise, which will be 11th Airborne's first exposure to our product. No one is worried, because they know you\u2019ve taken care of it.\n\n - You can get things from large government organizations Example: our engineer needs admin access to a system on JWICS, in order to diagnose technical issues. It\u2019s an unusual request, and no one at the customer knows what to do. Everyone tells you it\u2019s not possible, but you love a bureaucratic challenge. You solve the problem with a few phone calls\n\n - You\u2019re technically adept. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n - You work well with customers. You demonstrate strong interpersonal skills by cultivating trust, aligning diverse perspectives, and communicating with clarity and influence.\n\n - You\u2019re intense about our mission.

Our product is used in classified environments, often in moments that truly matter. That means our infrastructure needs to be trustworthy, scalable, and invisible when it works.\n\nWe\u2019re a mission-driven team with strong product instincts and a bias toward clarity. We are deployed across COCOMs and Joint Staff, and are still small enough for each new leader to shape how we scale.\n\nIf this role sounds like a fit, or you\u2019re curious to learn more, we\u2019d love to meet you.", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$240K \u2013 $310K \u2022 Offers Equity", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$240K - $310K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "8e619028-b87a-41c3-9c8e-1764da63daf8", "tierSummary": "$240K \u2013 $310K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "35d763b3-6b0d-4331-bf5d-9798449cb928", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "b37342d0-02e4-4750-84a4-543437777566", "summary": "$240K \u2013 $310K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 240000, "maxValue": 310000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 240000, "maxValue": 310000}]}}, {"id": "639ff94e-a5ab-4afb-9fb3-bdfa04a64fac", "title": "Operations Manager, U.S. Army Cyber Command", "department": "Customer Relations ", "team": "Customer Relations ", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Augusta, GA", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-09-22T17:45:51.405+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Georgia", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "Augusta"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/639ff94e-a5ab-4afb-9fb3-bdfa04a64fac", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/639ff94e-a5ab-4afb-9fb3-bdfa04a64fac/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h2><strong>About Onebrief</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Onebrief is collaboration and AI-powered workflow software designed specifically for military staffs.

By transforming this work, Onebrief makes the staff as a whole superhuman - meaning faster, smarter, and more efficient.\n\nWe take ownership, seek excellence, and play to win with the seriousness and camaraderie of an Olympic team. Onebrief operates as an all-remote company, though many of our employees work alongside our customers at military commands around the world.\n\nFounded in 2019 by a group of experienced planners, today, Onebrief\u2019s team spans veterans from all forces and global organizations, and technologists from leading-edge software companies. We\u2019ve raised $123m+ from top-tier investors, including Battery Ventures, General Catalyst, Insight Partners, and Human Capital, and today, Onebrief is valued at $1.1B. With this continued growth, Onebrief is able to make an impact where it matters most.\n\nRequired: Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI\n\nIn person in Fort Shafter, HI\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE\n\nAt each major headquarters under your responsibility,\n\n - Own the entire customer relationship, from users up to Generals/Admirals throughout the Joint Force.\n\n - Build strong relationships and trust with customers, positioning yourself as a trusted member of their team.\n\n - Rapidly expand product usage until the most important and impactful workflows are in Onebrief. You\u2019ll need a combination of ordinary training and subtler strategies to get our product used as much as possible.\n\n - Win the renewal and expansion, so that your customer(s) keep buying Onebrief each year. Deals should expand over time.\n\n - Clearly communicate user needs to the product team. Maintain a high product proficiency, and excite the customer about each product improvement.\n\n - Understand, request, and effectively leverage Company resources to meet the goals of the Company.\n\n - Instill the Onebrief brand image.\n\n - Enable our expansion to Allies and Partners.\n\n - Your responsibilities aren\u2019t limited to this list! We\u2019re on this great adventure together, and we\u2019ll each do what it takes for the team to succeed.\n\nYou will also:\n\n - Lead or support exercises.\n\n - Use your observations of our users to recommend product improvements.\n\n - Provide face-to-face and remote customer support.\n\n - Develop an understanding of customer social dynamics in order to support renewals and future sales.\n\n - When responding to incidents (product is unavailable, broken, or not delighting the customer), coordinate with the customer and our product engineering team.\n\n - Align your team\u2019s efforts to deliver the best customer experience, while coordinating with fellow Operations Managers to ensure planning and workflows remain synchronized across commands.\n\nTo succeed, you\u2019ll need a mastery of operational planning at multi-star headquarters. When you speak, do lead planners listen? Do Generals and Admirals?\n\nYou\u2019ll also need technical skill. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - You love our users, and you want to work with them. This is the single most important requirement. Implementing new software requires the enthusiastic support of our user base \u2014 skillful planners, primarily in the grade of O-4 and O-5. You understand them, and they confide in you. Users want you around, and see you as a valuable member of the team.\n\n - You deeply understand how military staffs function at echelon and want to apply that within USARPAC. Skillful planners, mainly SAMS, JAWS or SAW graduates in the rank of O-4 to O-6, respect you and care what you have to say. So do Generals and Admirals. You wake up excited each day to navigate the military and political bureaucracy and win over future customers.\n\n - You pay attention to detail. People rely on you. On your previous teams, you had a reputation as a workhorse. Example: we\u2019re about to run a planning exercise, which will be USARPAC's first exposure to our product. No one is worried, because they know you\u2019ve taken care of it.\n\n - You can get things from large government organizations Example: our engineer needs admin access to a system on JWICS, in order to diagnose technical issues. It\u2019s an unusual request, and no one at the customer knows what to do. Everyone tells you it\u2019s not possible, but you love a bureaucratic challenge. You solve the problem with a few phone calls\n\n - You\u2019re technically adept. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy. Can you become a power user of our product and talk engineering with the customer?\n\n - You work well with customers. You demonstrate strong interpersonal skills by cultivating trust, aligning diverse perspectives, and communicating with clarity and influence.\n\n - You\u2019re intense about our mission. It\u2019s a core part of who you are\n\n - You\u2019re proactive and adaptable. Comfortable working autonomously or with cross-functional teams, especially in fast-paced or ambiguous settings.\n\n - You communicate clearly, concisely, and candidly. Our Company relies on you to assess the situation within your account and effectively communicate your assessment and recommendations to inform strategic decisions.\n\n - You hold a current Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI and have the ability to access DOD facilities and installations.\n\nQualifications\n\n - Proven experience in leading operational planning within a military context, preferably at multi-star headquarters.\n\n - Exposure to large staff planning, through classical training in Professional Military Education or through service experience\n\n - Familiarity and experience with major military planning exercises and the protocols for software deployment on classified networks.\n\n - Proven ability to expand business presence within a region, with emphasis on software or technology solutions.\n\n - Experience in customer support, both face-to-face and remote, and capability to respond to incidents coordinating with customers and product engineering teams.\n\n - Strong technical skills to master our application, troubleshoot issues and liaise with customers on technical matters.\n\n - Proven ability to navigate large government organizations, solve bureaucratic challenges, and deliver successful outcomes.\n\n - Most importantly, you are a true Onebriefer:\n   \n   - You are obsessed with creating value for real users\n   \n   - You are ambitious, scrappy, and a creative problem-solver\n   \n   - You learn quickly, work iteratively, and naturally seek collaboration\n   \n   - You approach your work with integrity, intellectual honesty, and a low ego\n   \n   - You communicate frankly, clearly, and succinctly\n   \n   - You thrive as a self-starter, embracing autonomy and ambiguity\n\n\n", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$170K \u2013 $190K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Offers Bonus", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$170K - $190K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "854bece0-d3ec-4395-a4e4-b52a75f5dbdc", "tierSummary": "$170K \u2013 $190K \u2022 Offers Equity \u2022 Offers Bonus", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "00fc91c6-3cc6-4926-b28a-ccdadd2e39a4", "summary": "$170K \u2013 $190K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 170000, "maxValue": 190000}, {"id": "dfb909c3-cb75-45ae-9922-673e02bfe889", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "69635f93-a4c2-4900-93b8-ff72999124d9", "summary": "Offers Bonus", "compensationType": "Bonus", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 170000, "maxValue": 190000}, {"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"compensationType": "Bonus", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}]}}, {"id": "0d9c7274-fa74-464b-9296-53296d62b968", "title": "Senior Site Reliability Engineer, Colorado Springs", "department": "Infrastructure & Security", "team": "Infrastructure & Security", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "Oahu, HI", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [{"location": "Honolulu, HI", "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Hawaii", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "Honolulu"}}}], "publishedAt": "2025-10-21T23:38:33.688+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "Hawaii", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "Oahu"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/0d9c7274-fa74-464b-9296-53296d62b968", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/onebrief/0d9c7274-fa74-464b-9296-53296d62b968/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h2><strong>About Onebrief</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Onebrief is collaboration and AI-powered workflow software designed specifically for military staffs.

By transforming this work, Onebrief makes the staff as a whole superhuman - meaning faster, smarter, and more efficient.\n\nWe take ownership, seek excellence, and play to win with the seriousness and camaraderie of an Olympic team. Onebrief operates as an all-remote company, though many of our employees work alongside our customers at military commands around the world.\n\nFounded in 2019 by a group of experienced planners, today, Onebrief\u2019s team spans veterans from all forces and global organizations, and technologists from leading-edge software companies. We\u2019ve raised $123m+ from top-tier investors, including Battery Ventures, General Catalyst, Insight Partners, and Human Capital, and today, Onebrief is valued at $1.1B. With this continued growth, Onebrief is able to make an impact where it matters most.\n\nRequired: Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI\n\nIn person in Tampa, Florida.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - You love our users, and you want to work with them. This is the single most important requirement. Implementing new software requires the enthusiastic support of our user base \u2014 skillful planners, primarily in the grade of O-4 and O-5. You understand them, and they confide in you. Users want you around, and they ask you to have a beer.\n\n - You deeply understand large military headquarters and want to apply that within the CENTCOM. Skillful planners, mainly SAMS, JAWS or SAW graduates in the rank of O-4 to O-6, respect you and care what you have to say. So do Generals and Admirals. You wake up excited each day to navigate the military and political bureaucracy and win over future customers.\n\n - You pay attention to detail. People rely on you. On your previous teams, you had a reputation as a workhorse. Example: we\u2019re about to run a planning exercise, which will be the clients first exposure to our product. No one is worried, because they know you\u2019ve taken care of it.\n\n - You can get things from large government organizations Example: our engineer needs admin access to a system on JWICS, in order to diagnose technical issues. It\u2019s an unusual request, and no one at the customer knows what to do. Everyone tells you it\u2019s not possible, but you love a bureaucratic challenge. You solve the problem with a few phone calls\n\n - You\u2019re technically adept. You don\u2019t need to code, but you do need to be savvy.
