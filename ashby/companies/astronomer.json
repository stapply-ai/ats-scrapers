Gain depth and breadth of learning!\n\n - Work directly with our customers\u2019 data engineers, system admins, DevOps teams, and management.\n\n - Provide feedback from your experience that can shape the direction of the Airflow project.\n\n - Own the customer experience, working directly with customers to prioritize and solve issues, meet SLAs, and provide \u201cwhite glove\u201d guidance on the path to production.\n\n - Participate remotely within a fully distributed team.\n\n - Help maintain 24x7 coverage through a specified 6-hour pager period during your work day.\n\n - Participate in paid on-call rotation for weekend coverage.\n\n\nWHAT YOU BRING TO THE ROLE:\n\n - 5 years of professional experience (any industry)\n\n - 3 years of experience with Python\n\n - 1+ year with Apache Airflow\n\n - Experience with Kubernetes/Docker/Container\n\n - Customer Support experience\n\n - Experience working with a distributed system with any major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)\n\n - Problem-solving and troubleshooting abilities\n\n - Work well with autonomy and independence\n\n - Strong written and verbal communication for connecting with our customers over our ticketing system and through Zoom\n\n\nBONUS POINTS IF YOU HAVE:\n\n - Familiarity with SQL and PostgreSQL\n\n - Familiarity with Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift, dbt, or other similar data engineering tools\n\n#LI-Fulltime\n\nAt Astronomer, we value diversity.
