Flag weak points in the scheduling or communications flow and suggest process changes that make things faster, clearer, and more consistent.\n\nSupport the full recruiting operation.

You catch what others miss.\n\n - You move fast and keep things moving. You manage multiple threads without dropping them, and people trust that if it\u2019s in your hands, it\u2019s handled.\n\n - You care about people. You treat every candidate with warmth and attentiveness, and you help interviewers stay grounded and informed.\n\n - You communicate clearly. Your Slack messages, emails, and docs are thoughtful and professional, even when you\u2019re in a rush.\n\n - You\u2019re eager to learn. You get better every week by reflecting, asking questions, and suggesting improvements.\n\nBonus (But Not Required)\n\nExperience in recruiting, coordination, hospitality, sales, events, or startup operations\n\nFamiliarity with Notion, Slack, Google Calendar, ATS systems, or basic trigger automations\n\nExposure to fast-paced environments or customer-facing roles", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": null, "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": null, "compensationTiers": [], "summaryComponents": []}}, {"id": "5bef09c2-fc72-4f20-8bd3-1b221cfa89d0", "title": "Administrative Generalist", "department": "Operations", "team": "Admin", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "San Francisco", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": false, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-09-09T19:41:56.561+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "California", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "San Francisco"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mercor/5bef09c2-fc72-4f20-8bd3-1b221cfa89d0", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mercor/5bef09c2-fc72-4f20-8bd3-1b221cfa89d0/application", "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mercor.com/\"><u>Mercor</u></a> is hiring an <strong>Admin Generalist</strong>!
