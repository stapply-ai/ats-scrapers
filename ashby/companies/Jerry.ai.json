We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years \u2014 scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company\u2019s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.\n\nJerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible \u2013 insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc \u2013 a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we\u2019ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.\n\nHere's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:\n\n\"The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).\n\nThe benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.\n\nI have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"\n\nHow you will make an impact:\n\n - Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies\n\n - Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies\n\n - Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth\n\n - Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency\n\nPreferred experience:\n\n - Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline\n\n - 1+ years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis\n\n - High level of comfort with SQL or Python\n\nWho you are:\n\n - You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles\n\n - You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company\u2019s C-suite\n\n - You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence\n\nWhile we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.\n\nJerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

We\u2019re building the first AI-powered AllCar\u2122 super app to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we\u2019re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we\u2019re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M \u2192 50M users next.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Core Marketplace Automation Team, building automation systems that let our users self-serve, stay insured, and get the smoothest experience possible. This is a rare opportunity to work on software that directly impacts millions of users, automate complex business processes, and shape the future of insurance tech.\n\nWhy you\u2019ll love working here\n\n - Real world impact: Your code touches millions of end users every day. Our automation systems already handle complex tasks like document uploads/verification, policy changes, payment, cancellations, and renewals \u2014 now we need to make them faster, smarter, and more seamless.\n\n - Meaningful work: Build tools that automate hundreds of human agent hours and scale our business efficiently. You\u2019ll tackle different types of challenges every day, learning both the technical and business sides of our core products.\n\n - Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow-moving processes.\n\n - Brilliant + supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed.\n\n - Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early \u2014 without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally.\n\n - Growth + learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do\n\n - Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.\n\n - Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1\u20132 weeks on average.\n\n - Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.\n\n - Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences.\n\n - Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.\n\n - Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.\n\n - Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.\n\n - Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.\n\nWhat we\u2019re looking for\n\n - Experience: At least 5 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software.\n\n - Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks.\n\n - Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.\n\n - Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.\n\n - Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills.\n\n - Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.\n\nOur stack\n\n - Frontend & backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo\n\n - API: GraphQL\n\n - Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis\n\n - Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda\n\nWhy Jerry?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another coding job \u2014 you\u2019ll be solving real-world problems at scale, helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You\u2019ll work in a flexible, fast-moving, and highly collaborative culture, where innovation is encouraged, your voice is heard, and the impact of your work is immediate. You\u2019ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn constantly, and grow alongside extremely talented engineers.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 If this sounds like your kind of place, we want to meet you!\n\nWhile we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.\n\nJerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.
