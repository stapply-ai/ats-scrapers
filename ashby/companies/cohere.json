Compensation for services is provided to contractors by contractors invoicing for services provided pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the contractor.\n\nIt is important to understand that as an independent contractor, continuous work is not guaranteed. The client-contractor relationship is fundamentally project-based, meaning engagements may be temporary, periodic, or intermittent based on our organizational needs and project availability. As an independent contractor, you should anticipate fluctuations in workflow and, therefore, compensation for services when Cohere does not require as many hours of services in a week.\n\nProspective candidates, please be advised: this role involves working with human-generated and model-generated tasks that may involve exposure to not safe for work (NSFW) text content as part of data annotation tasks, including explicit, offensive, or other inappropriate material.\n\nIf some of the above doesn\u2019t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!\n\nWe value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our mission is to push the boundaries of machine learning by tackling frontier challenges and opening new pathways for discovery. We believe the future of AI will be shaped not only by technical breakthroughs, but also by creating spaces where diverse communities of researchers, engineers, and multidisciplinary experts can come together to explore bold ideas.\n\nWe pursue this mission in two ways:\n\n 1. Creating open research spaces that connect people across backgrounds to contribute to cutting-edge ML and NLP research.\n\n 2. Expanding access to research training, bringing in fresh voices and perspectives from around the world.\n\nAbout the role\n\nAs a Senior Research Scientist at Cohere Labs, you\u2019ll drive an independent, high-impact research agenda on frontier topics in AI. You\u2019ll have the freedom to ask ambitious questions, explore the unknown, and publish your findings openly. We\u2019re particularly excited by work that not only advances science, but also engages with the societal implications of machine learning.\n\nThis role is for someone who thrives at the intersection of leading and learning: advancing frontier research with global collaborations, guiding new researchers, and opening doors for broader participation in ML research.\n\nYou may be a fit if you:\n\n - Have a PhD (or equivalent research experience) with a strong track record of publications in ML, AI, statistics, or related fields.\n\n - Bring expertise or deep curiosity in areas such as: efficiency, optimization, reasoning, multimodality, agentic systems, human\u2013AI collaboration.\n\n - Have solid machine learning and NLP fundamentals, with experience in shaping and executing original research.\n\n - Enjoy collaborating across disciplines and geographies.\n\n - Care about mentoring and supporting the next generation of researchers.\n\nAt Cohere Labs, we don\u2019t just work on today\u2019s problems \u2014 we\u2019re building foundations for the future of AI research. If you want to explore big questions, collaborate widely, and make lasting contributions, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nIf some of the above doesn\u2019t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!\n\nWe value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Each person is one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for building great products.\n\nJoin us on our mission and shape the future!\n\nLocation: Whilst Cohere is a remote friendly organisation, to ensure close collaboration with key partners, this hire must be based between East Coast US / CAN and Central Europe. If office working is preferred, then we welcome candidates to join us in our Toronto, Montreal, NYC, London or Paris locations.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe're seeking a Safety Operations Lead to join our team on the East Coast or in Europe. In this role, you'll be at the intersection of AI safety and operational excellence, managing end-to-end data annotation projects that are critical to developing safer, more reliable AI systems. You'll work closely with our Safety Modeling team to translate complex safety concepts (from identifying harmful bias to preventing misuse) into clear, scalable labeling projects. Your responsibilities will span the full lifecycle of data operations: designing and piloting annotation projects, building robust quality assurance frameworks, managing our in-house team of expert annotators, and overseeing relationships with external vendors to ensure they meet our rigorous standards. Beyond execution, you'll drive strategic planning by forecasting data needs, managing budgets, and establishing KPIs that ensure quality, throughput, and cost-effectiveness. This is an opportunity to shape how AI safety data is collected, managed, and delivered at scale, requiring strong leadership, meticulous project management, and a deep commitment to AI safety principles.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\n - Collaborate and Identify Data Needs: Work closely with our Safety Modeling team to deeply understand their data requirements for e.g. model training, evaluation or red-teaming.\n\n - Operationalize Data Needs: Translate complex safety concepts (e.g., identifying harmful bias, preventing misuse) into clear, actionable data annotation instructions and scalable labeling projects.\n\n - End-to-End Project Management: Manage the entire lifecycle of data annotation projects, from initial design and pilot phases through to final data delivery, ensuring we meet ambitious quality and timeline goals.\n\n - Build Quality Systems: Design, implement, and refine robust quality assurance (QA) frameworks and feedback loops to monitor data accuracy, track annotator performance, and continuously improve our annotation workflows.\n\n - Lead an Internal Team: Manage our in-house team of data annotators. This includes hiring, onboarding, continuous training, performance management, and day-to-day operations to foster a high-performing, expert team.\n\n - Manage External Partners: Oversee relationships with external annotation vendors, including project scoping, setup, tracking execution against SLAs, and performing regular quality audits to ensure they meet our rigorous standards.\n\n - Define and Drive Success: Establish, monitor, and report on key performance indicators (KPIs) for all data annotation efforts. You will hold both internal and external teams accountable for quality, throughput, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n - Strategic Planning: Drive resource planning by creating roadmaps that anticipate future data needs, forecasting internal hiring requirements, and managing budgets for external vendor engagements.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\n - 3+ years of experience in data annotation, data operations, or a similar operational role within a technology-focused environment.\n\n - A strong background or deep domain expertise in areas crucial to AI Safety, such as LLM safety principles, content moderation, trust & safety, policy development, or online risk analysis.\n\n - Proven track record of managing complex data labeling or content review projects from inception to completion.\n\n - 2+ years of direct people management experience, with a demonstrated ability to hire, train, and develop high-performing operational teams.\n\n - Exceptional organizational and project management skills, with an ability to manage multiple complex projects simultaneously.\n\n - A data-driven mindset with experience in defining and tracking metrics to improve operational performance.\n\n - Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to work effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n\nBonus Points\n\n - Experience working directly with third-party data labeling vendors and platforms (e.g., Scale AI, Appen, Surge AI).\n\n - Familiarity with the challenges of subjective data and developing annotation guidelines for nuanced tasks.\n\n - Basic proficiency in SQL or a scripting language (like Python) for data analysis and workflow automation.\n\nIf some of the above doesn\u2019t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!\n\nWe value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities.
