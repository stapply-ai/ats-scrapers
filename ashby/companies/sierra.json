This includes building features in the web app and also collaborating on our website to keep branding and user experience consistent and high-quality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Lead design system and UI components</strong>: You\u2019ll design, build, and maintain a scalable design system and reusable component library that empowers all our engineers and designers. By delivering robust, high-quality UI components and infrastructure, you will ensure consistency and excellence across all product surfaces. You\u2019ll also collaborate with designers to establish guidelines and patterns, enabling the team to rapidly build beautiful, consistent UIs with confidence.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Craft pixel-perfect user experiences</strong>: Work closely with our design team to translate Figma designs into reality with pixel-perfect precision and delightful interactions. You will partner with designers to refine UI patterns and ensure every detail is right \u2013 from typography and spacing to motion and hover states. We care deeply about design craft, so you\u2019ll sweat the details to build an interface that feels elegant, intuitive, and \u201cjust right\u201d for users.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Champion frontend excellence</strong>: As the senior frontend expert, you will set and uphold high standards for performance, accessibility, and code quality. You\u2019ll optimize our frontend for speed (efficient loading, bundle size, smooth rendering) and ensure our product works flawlessly across browsers and devices. You will also incorporate best practices for accessibility and internationalization, making our product usable by all customers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Move fast with pragmatism and quality</strong>: In our startup environment, you\u2019ll iterate quickly to ship improvements and new features. You\u2019ll make thoughtful engineering trade-offs that balance rapid delivery with maintainability and polish. This means knowing when to build a quick solution and when to invest in the long-term path \u2013 always keeping user experience and business impact in mind.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Full-stack involvement</strong>: While your focus will be frontend, you should be comfortable venturing into the backend when needed. You\u2019ll integrate frontend features with our GraphQL API and occasionally update server-side code (we use Go/gqlgen) to unblock frontend work. In short, you\u2019ll do what it takes across the stack to deliver a great end-to-end product experience \u2013 without ever sacrificing our high bar for UI quality.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What You'll Bring:</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Frontend expertise and modern skills</strong>: Extensive experience (5+ years) building world-class web interfaces using React, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. You have a proven track record of shipping polished user interfaces in production products . Bonus points if you\u2019ve worked with Tailwind or similar modern CSS frameworks for rapid development.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Design sense and attention to detail</strong>: You have a keen eye for good design and care deeply about the details of the user experience. We look for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship and getting even the smallest details right\u2014this aligns with Sierra\u2019s value of <em>craftsmanship</em>. You take pride in creating pixel-perfect, intuitive UIs and will proactively fix even minor UI issues because you value quality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Strong collaboration and communication</strong>: You excel at working closely with designers and product managers to achieve the best outcome. You partner with product and design teams to craft beautiful user experiences , and you communicate clearly about tradeoffs and solutions. You\u2019re open to feedback and can articulate your ideas in discussions, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Self-motivation and drive</strong>: You are intensely goal-oriented and proactive, able to take ownership of projects with minimal guidance. You\u2019ve thrived in fast-paced environments and have a track record of delivering projects quickly and frequently. You can manage ambiguity and complexity, breaking down big problems into simple, workable solutions. In short, you get things done with speed and quality in equal measure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Pragmatic problem-solving</strong>: You approach engineering with practicality. You make effective trade-offs between ideal solutions and pragmatic deliverables, always considering the user impact and long-term maintainability. You\u2019re not ideological about technology \u2013 you choose the best tool for the job and can learn new technologies on the fly as needed.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Front-to-back understanding</strong>: While specializing in frontend, you have a solid understanding of backend fundamentals. You know how web APIs, databases, and servers work. If needed, you can read and write server-side code. In particular, experience with GraphQL APIs and/or Golang (our backend language) is a plus for this role.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Even better...</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Design systems experience</strong>: Previous experience building or contributing to design systems or component libraries \u2013 either at a company or in open-source\u2014would be a big plus . This means you\u2019ve helped create shared UI frameworks with Figma.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>UI/UX specialization</strong>: An eye for user experience beyond coding \u2014e.g. some experience with user research, visual design, or interaction design\u2014would help you excel in crafting a delightful product. If you\u2019ve worked closely with UX designers or have design skills yourself, that\u2019s a bonus.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Domain experience</strong>: Exposure to AI or ML products, especially building UIs for complex data or AI-driven features. For example, if you\u2019ve built chat interfaces, analytics dashboards, or enterprise SaaS products before, you\u2019ll have useful relevant experience.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Full-stack prowess</strong>: Experience with our broader tech stack is helpful. This could mean familiarity with GraphQL (and libraries like gqlgen or Relay), Go or other back-end languages, and cloud platforms. While not required, such experience means you can hit the ground running across our codebase .</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Startup mentality</strong>: You\u2019ve been an early engineer at a startup or small team before. You understand the intensity and flexibility needed in a startup environment and are excited to wear many hats. If you love taking initiative and having a broad impact, you\u2019ll fit right in.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Our values</strong></h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Trust: </strong>We build trust with our customers with our accountability, empathy, quality, and responsiveness.

We are primarily an in-person company based in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, and London.\n\n - We are guided by a set of values that are at the core of our actions and define our culture: Trust, Customer Obsession, Craftsmanship, Intensity, and Family. These values are the foundation of our work, and we are committed to upholding them in everything we do.\n\n - Our co-founders are Bret Taylor https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettaylor/ and Clay Bavor https://www.linkedin.com/in/claybavor/. Bret currently serves as Board Chair of OpenAI. Previously, he was co-CEO of Salesforce (which had acquired the company he founded, Quip) and CTO of Facebook. Bret was also one of Google's earliest product managers and co-creator of Google Maps. Before founding Sierra, Clay spent 18 years at Google, where he most recently led Google Labs. Earlier, he started and led Google\u2019s AR/VR effort, Project Starline, and Google Lens. Before that, Clay led the product and design teams for Google Workspace.\u00a0\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO:\n\n - Own frontend across product and marketing surfaces: You will work across both our core product interface and customer-facing web pages, ensuring a cohesive, polished user experience across all touch points. This includes building features in the web app and also collaborating on our website to keep branding and user experience consistent and high-quality.\n\n - Lead design system and UI components: You\u2019ll design, build, and maintain a scalable design system and reusable component library that empowers all our engineers and designers. By delivering robust, high-quality UI components and infrastructure, you will ensure consistency and excellence across all product surfaces. You\u2019ll also collaborate with designers to establish guidelines and patterns, enabling the team to rapidly build beautiful, consistent UIs with confidence.\n\n - Craft pixel-perfect user experiences: Work closely with our design team to translate Figma designs into reality with pixel-perfect precision and delightful interactions. You will partner with designers to refine UI patterns and ensure every detail is right \u2013 from typography and spacing to motion and hover states. We care deeply about design craft, so you\u2019ll sweat the details to build an interface that feels elegant, intuitive, and \u201cjust right\u201d for users.\n\n - Champion frontend excellence: As the senior frontend expert, you will set and uphold high standards for performance, accessibility, and code quality. You\u2019ll optimize our frontend for speed (efficient loading, bundle size, smooth rendering) and ensure our product works flawlessly across browsers and devices. You will also incorporate best practices for accessibility and internationalization, making our product usable by all customers.\n\n - Move fast with pragmatism and quality: In our startup environment, you\u2019ll iterate quickly to ship improvements and new features. You\u2019ll make thoughtful engineering trade-offs that balance rapid delivery with maintainability and polish. This means knowing when to build a quick solution and when to invest in the long-term path \u2013 always keeping user experience and business impact in mind.\n\n - Full-stack involvement: While your focus will be frontend, you should be comfortable venturing into the backend when needed. You\u2019ll integrate frontend features with our GraphQL API and occasionally update server-side code (we use Go/gqlgen) to unblock frontend work. In short, you\u2019ll do what it takes across the stack to deliver a great end-to-end product experience \u2013 without ever sacrificing our high bar for UI quality.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL BRING:\n\n - Frontend expertise and modern skills: Extensive experience (5+ years) building world-class web interfaces using React, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. You have a proven track record of shipping polished user interfaces in production products . Bonus points if you\u2019ve worked with Tailwind or similar modern CSS frameworks for rapid development.\n\n - Design sense and attention to detail: You have a keen eye for good design and care deeply about the details of the user experience. We look for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship and getting even the smallest details right\u2014this aligns with Sierra\u2019s value of craftsmanship. You take pride in creating pixel-perfect, intuitive UIs and will proactively fix even minor UI issues because you value quality.\n\n - Strong collaboration and communication: You excel at working closely with designers and product managers to achieve the best outcome. You partner with product and design teams to craft beautiful user experiences , and you communicate clearly about tradeoffs and solutions. You\u2019re open to feedback and can articulate your ideas in discussions, ensuring everyone is on the same page.\n\n - Self-motivation and drive: You are intensely goal-oriented and proactive, able to take ownership of projects with minimal guidance. You\u2019ve thrived in fast-paced environments and have a track record of delivering projects quickly and frequently. You can manage ambiguity and complexity, breaking down big problems into simple, workable solutions. In short, you get things done with speed and quality in equal measure.\n\n - Pragmatic problem-solving: You approach engineering with practicality. You make effective trade-offs between ideal solutions and pragmatic deliverables, always considering the user impact and long-term maintainability. You\u2019re not ideological about technology \u2013 you choose the best tool for the job and can learn new technologies on the fly as needed.\n\n - Front-to-back understanding: While specializing in frontend, you have a solid understanding of backend fundamentals. You know how web APIs, databases, and servers work. If needed, you can read and write server-side code. In particular, experience with GraphQL APIs and/or Golang (our backend language) is a plus for this role.\n\n\nEVEN BETTER...\n\n - Design systems experience: Previous experience building or contributing to design systems or component libraries \u2013 either at a company or in open-source\u2014would be a big plus . This means you\u2019ve helped create shared UI frameworks with Figma.\n\n - UI/UX specialization: An eye for user experience beyond coding \u2014e.g. some experience with user research, visual design, or interaction design\u2014would help you excel in crafting a delightful product. If you\u2019ve worked closely with UX designers or have design skills yourself, that\u2019s a bonus.\n\n - Domain experience: Exposure to AI or ML products, especially building UIs for complex data or AI-driven features. For example, if you\u2019ve built chat interfaces, analytics dashboards, or enterprise SaaS products before, you\u2019ll have useful relevant experience.\n\n - Full-stack prowess: Experience with our broader tech stack is helpful. This could mean familiarity with GraphQL (and libraries like gqlgen or Relay), Go or other back-end languages, and cloud platforms. While not required, such experience means you can hit the ground running across our codebase .\n\n - Startup mentality: You\u2019ve been an early engineer at a startup or small team before. You understand the intensity and flexibility needed in a startup environment and are excited to wear many hats. If you love taking initiative and having a broad impact, you\u2019ll fit right in.\n\n\nOUR VALUES\n\n - Trust: We build trust with our customers with our accountability, empathy, quality, and responsiveness. We build trust in AI by making it more accessible, safe, and useful. We build trust with each other by showing up for each other professionally and personally, creating an environment that enables all of us to do our best work.\n\n - Customer Obsession: We deeply understand our customers\u2019 business goals and relentlessly focus on driving outcomes, not just technical milestones. Everyone at the company knows and spends time with our customers. When our customer is having an issue, we drop everything and fix it.\n\n - Craftsmanship: We get the details right, from the words on the page to the system architecture. We have good taste. When we notice something isn\u2019t right, we take the time to fix it. We are proud of the products we produce. We continuously self-reflect to continuously self-improve.\n\n - Intensity: We know we don\u2019t have the luxury of patience. We play to win. We care about our product being the best, and when it isn\u2019t, we fix it. When we fail, we talk about it openly and without blame so we succeed the next time.\n\n - Family: We know that balance and intensity are compatible, and we model it in our actions and processes. We are the best technology company for parents. We support and respect each other and celebrate each other\u2019s personal and professional achievements.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\nWe want our benefits to reflect our values and offer the following to full-time employees:\n\n - Flexible (Unlimited) Paid Time Off\n\n - Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits for you and your family\n\n - Life Insurance and Disability Benefits\n\n - Retirement Plan (e.g., 401K, pension) with Sierra match\n\n - Parental Leave\n\n - Fertility and family building benefits through Carrot\n\n - Lunch, as well as delicious snacks and coffee to keep you energized\u00a0\n\n - Discretionary Benefit Stipend giving people the ability to spend where it matters most\n\n - Free alphorn lessons\n\nThese benefits are further detailed in Sierra's policies and are subject to change at any time, consistent with the terms of any applicable compensation or benefits plans.
