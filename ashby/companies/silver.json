These tools don\u2019t know about the team\u2019s time and resources and don\u2019t have any intelligence \u2014 someone has to manually match tasks against their assumptions about the team\u2019s capacity.

Teams that use Motion know what people are working on at any given time, when each task will be completed, and whether any tasks will fall behind schedule. The moment something changes, instead of the coordinator having to figure out all the cascading effects, Motion instantly creates a new optimized plan for the team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Motion is the project management system of the future.
