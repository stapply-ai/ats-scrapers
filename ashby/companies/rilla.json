In numbers, that means 0\u2192$40M in 3.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone\u2019s, and profitability.\n\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nRilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed. On a daily basis, you will build end-to-end workflows, take them to production, and solve real world problems across an out-sized scale.\n\nAs an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision\u2011making, setting patterns that cement a world\u2011class engineering culture as we scale. While the company 10\u00d7\u2019s, your scope and ownership will grow just as fast\u2014building the tools, mental models, and platforms that let both you and Rilla accelerate exponentially.\n\nDo you describe yourself as \"obsessive\"? Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place \u2014 with the best peers \u2014 to learn how.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGIES WE USE\n\n - Different languages and frameworks, including React, React Native, Typescript and Python\n\n - Open-source technologies like Node.js, PostgreSQL, Turborepo, Lodash, and Zod\n\n - Industry-standard build tooling, including GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Spacelift\n\n\nWHAT WE VALUE\n\n - An infinite learner. Someone who is relentless in their curiosity.\n\n - A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics.\n\n - A winning attitude. You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback.\n\n - Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions.\n\n - Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.\n\n\nWHAT WE REQUIRE\n\n - Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages.\n\n - Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start-ups.\n\n - Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.\n\n - Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.\n\n\nDON\u2019T WORK HERE\n\nPlease don't join if you're not excited about:\n\n 1. Building an AI product for an industry untouched by modern software\n\n 2. Constantly talking to and visiting customers in the field\n\n 3. Working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC\n\n 4. Attempting to build a generational company, and the intensity required to do so\n\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nThe estimated salary range for this position is $230,000 - $300,000/year.\n\nSuccessful candidates with competing offers will receive matching and competitive offers.\n\nTotal compensation for this position may also include Incentive Stock Options, sign-on bonus, and other potential future incentives.
