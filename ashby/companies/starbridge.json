Events and field experiences have been a growth engine for us, now we need someone who can push the creativity, scale, and impact even further.\n\nThis role is part builder, part strategist. One week you\u2019re designing an in-booth product activation at a major conference. The next, you\u2019re orchestrating an executive dinner series or a city-by-city roadshow. You\u2019ll create memorable, product-driven experiences that stand out, drive pipeline, and help sellers win.\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL DO:\n\n - Create scrappy, high-impact activations. You\u2019ll dream up ways to showcase product in the field: live demos, interactive stations, creative swag, or surprise moments that make people stop and talk.\n\n - Run events end-to-end. From trade shows to our first user conference next year, you\u2019ll handle strategy, logistics, and execution, rolling up your sleeves to make things happen.\n\n - Test new plays. Pilot roadshows, co-hosted activations, or unconventional ideas that break through the noise and quickly double down on what works.\n\n - Build the field engine. Start scrappy, then turn experiments into repeatable playbooks we can scale with partners, vendors, and tech.\n\n - Work hand-in-hand with sales and product. Ensure every activation is tightly connected to pipeline and that our product shines in the spotlight.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A FIT IF:\n\n - You\u2019ve got 2+ years of experience running field or event marketing at an early/mid-stage B2B SaaS company.\n\n - You know how to tie creativity to outcomes: pipeline, brand buzz, customer love.\n\n - You\u2019re not afraid to experiment and iterate.\n\n - You're willing to be on the road at minimum once a month.\n\nWhy Join Starbridge\n\n - Ownership: Your impact will be as large as you want it to be; we are an incredibly flat team that rewards high performers very quickly.\n\n - Autonomy: You\u2019ll have freedom to innovate and iterate alongside the team.\n\n - Team: Work alongside sharp, collaborative colleagues who value craft and execution.\n\n - Mission: Help modern companies sell into a $1.5T public sector with better intelligence.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n - Competitive salary + early-stage equity\n\n - Company provided Lunch in office everyday\n\n - Complimentary gym (Chelsea Piers Fitness) membership\n\n - Unlimited PTO\n\n - Regular offsites (NYC + global locations)", "compensation": {"compensationTierSummary": "$110K \u2013 $170K \u2022 Offers Equity", "scrapeableCompensationSalarySummary": "$110K - $170K", "compensationTiers": [{"id": "45e17c9b-018a-46fa-be2f-2165b051470f", "tierSummary": "$110K \u2013 $170K \u2022 Offers Equity", "title": null, "additionalInformation": null, "components": [{"id": "d8edac96-39ee-4e85-9ffd-544958dae640", "summary": "Offers Equity", "compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"id": "5c9b2da9-8968-4db9-97a8-de2ff9eefc32", "summary": "$110K \u2013 $170K", "compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 110000, "maxValue": 170000}]}], "summaryComponents": [{"compensationType": "EquityPercentage", "interval": "NONE", "currencyCode": null, "minValue": null, "maxValue": null}, {"compensationType": "Salary", "interval": "1 YEAR", "currencyCode": "USD", "minValue": 110000, "maxValue": 170000}]}}, {"id": "f74bbcff-15b2-4875-9dac-e99eb2ff587b", "title": "Senior Backend Software Engineer - Java/Kotlin (NYC)", "department": "Engineering", "team": "Engineering", "employmentType": "FullTime", "location": "New York City", "shouldDisplayCompensationOnJobPostings": true, "secondaryLocations": [], "publishedAt": "2025-10-18T00:13:58.521+00:00", "isListed": true, "isRemote": false, "address": {"postalAddress": {"addressRegion": "New York", "addressCountry": "United States", "addressLocality": "New York"}}, "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/starbridge/f74bbcff-15b2-4875-9dac-e99eb2ff587b", "applyUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/starbridge/f74bbcff-15b2-4875-9dac-e99eb2ff587b/application", "descriptionHtml": "<h1><strong>About the role</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We are looking for a remote generalist senior backend engineer with experience in Java (and preferably Kotlin) to join our early team to build our product from zero to one.
