And people who care\u2014about each other, about UiPath, and about our larger purpose.\n\nCould that be you?\n\n\nYOUR MISSION\n\nAs a Software Engineer on the Driver team, you\u2019ll be at the heart of how users interact with automation. The Driver team builds the automation drivers that power UiPath's interaction layer across a wide range of platforms \u2013 from modern browsers and native desktop apps to legacy systems.\nYour role will be to design and develop automation capabilities that make our platform more adaptable, performant, and intuitive. Whether you're deep-diving into OS internals or optimizing DOM-level interactions, your work will help UiPath deliver on its promise of the Fully Automated Enterprise\u2122 \u2014 where automation removes barriers to scale and unleashes human potential.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do at UiPath\n\n - Design and implement core automation capabilities for the Driver layer.\n\n - Develop support for interacting with both web and desktop applications across various UI frameworks (e.g., Win32, WPF, web-based UIs).\n\n - Ensure the delivery of performant, secure, and maintainable code that meets scalability and extensibility requirements.\n\n - Adapt automation capabilities to accommodate new operating system updates, UI technologies, and diverse customer environments.\n\n - Debug and optimize low-level components that interface directly with system and browser APIs.\n\n - Maintain a high bar for code quality, testability, and cross-platform consistency in the automation layer.\n\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Bring to the Team\n\n - Strong programming skills in one or more of the following: C++, C, JavaScript, TypeScript or C#\u2014 and a curiosity to learn others.\n\n - Solid understanding of object-oriented programming and software design patterns.\n\n - Experience with asynchronous programming, multithreading, and synchronization mechanisms.\n\n - Strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and time/memory complexity analysis.\n\n - Comfortable working close to the OS \u2014 understanding how applications interact with system-level APIs.\n\n - Familiarity with browser internals, DOM APIs, and desktop UI frameworks like WPF, Windows Forms, or Electron would represent a plus.\n\n - Experience with low-level Windows technologies (e.g., Windows API, COM, ATL), reverse engineering, and debugging tools such as WinDbg or Procmon would represent a plus,\n\n\nWhy Join the Driver Team at UiPath?\nWe're the team that makes automation possible at the interaction layer. Every OS update, UI framework, or customer scenario presents a new challenge \u2014 and an opportunity to innovate. You'll never get bored here: there\u2019s always something new to explore, reverse-engineer, or optimize. You\u2019ll work in a highly technical, low-ego environment where engineering depth is valued, and your work has direct, global impact. If you enjoy solving hard problems and building scalable, elegant solutions that power real-world automation, the Driver team is where you belong.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t tick all the boxes above\u2014but still think you\u2019d be great for the job? Go ahead, apply anyway. Please. Because we know that experience comes in all shapes and sizes\u2014and passion can\u2019t be learned.\n\nMany of our roles allow for flexibility in when and where work gets done. Depending on the needs of the business and the role, the number of hybrid, office-based, and remote workers will vary from team to team. Applications are assessed on a rolling basis and there is no fixed deadline for this requisition. The application window may change depending on the volume of applications received or may close immediately if a qualified candidate is selected.\n\nWe value a range of diverse backgrounds, experiences and ideas.

We\u2019re committed to creating category-leading enterprise software that unleashes that power.\n\nTo make that happen, we need people who are curious, self-propelled, generous, and genuine. People who love being part of a fast-moving, fast-thinking growth company. And people who care\u2014about each other, about UiPath, and about our larger purpose.\n\nCould that be you?\n\n\nYOUR MISSION\n\nThis role owns the vision and product direction of UiPath\u2019s Agentic Automation Core Infrastructure, driving foundational services like the UiPath LLM Gateway, context grounding, tool-calling frameworks, interoperability across LLMs, and secure on-prem execution. You will define how agents are governed, grounded, and safely extended while ensuring every automation and AI agent built on UiPath runs reliably, securely, and at enterprise scale. Your north star is trust and scalability: measurable increases in enterprise adoption of agentic automation, enabled by infrastructure that is both robust and developer friendly.\n\nThis position demands large-scope ownership combining deep technical fluency, platform-scale thinking, and the ability to balance innovation with enterprise-grade guardrails.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO AT UIPATH\n\n - Own the long-term vision and roadmap for UiPath\u2019s agentic automation core infrastructure, guiding major investments in AI governance, interoperability, and runtime reliability.\n\n - Evolve and scale the UiPath LLM Gateway, ensuring enterprise customers get quick, efficient and trusted access to the latest models.\n\n - Drive interoperability across models and frameworks, making it seamless to plug in and orchestrate a variety of LLMs (open-source and proprietary) within the UiPath platform.\n\n - Champion on-prem and hybrid execution, enabling customers with strict data-governance needs to run agents and core infra components securely in their own environments.\n\n - Design and deliver guardrails, ensuring agents can reliably execute tasks with enterprise trust requirements (permissions, approvals, error handling).\n\n - Advance UiPath Context Grounding capabilities, powering high-fidelity, enterprise-aware agent experiences that minimize hallucinations and maximize accuracy.\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, security, cloud, AI/ML, and go-to-market teams to deliver high-impact infra releases on schedule.\n\n - Define and track platform health metrics (latency, reliability, compliance coverage, model interoperability) and use data to drive iteration.\n\n - Serve as a visible leader internally and externally, articulating UiPath\u2019s approach to safe, scalable agentic infrastructure at industry forums, partner engagements, and customer briefings.\n\n - Mentor and elevate teams on infrastructure best practices, responsible AI patterns, and scalable architecture for enterprise-grade agentic workflows\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL BRING TO THE TEAM\n\n - 10+ years of experience in product management or platform engineering with a strong record of shipping enterprise-grade infrastructure products (AI governance, cloud platforms, or developer frameworks).\n\n - Proven technical fluency with AI/ML systems, cloud infrastructure, and security/compliance frameworks.\n\n - Hands-on familiarity with AI orchestration and model-interoperability (e.g., integrating multiple LLMs, managing runtime execution).\n\n - Experience driving on-prem/hybrid deployment models in regulated or security-sensitive industries.\n\n - Strong understanding of guardrails, policy enforcement, and safe tool-calling frameworks in agentic/AI environments.\n\n - Track record of data-driven decision making, using telemetry to optimize infrastructure performance, adoption, and reliability.\n\n - Exceptional leadership and communication skills\u2014able to align engineering, architecture, and business stakeholders around complex infrastructure decisions.\n\n - Passion for responsible GenAI and automation, with a clear vision for how trusted, scalable infra enables enterprise-wide agentic workflows on the UiPath platform.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t tick all the boxes above\u2014but still think you\u2019d be great for the job?
